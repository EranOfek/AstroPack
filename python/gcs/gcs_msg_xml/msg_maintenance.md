# 3-3   Maintenance activities on the Payload

Apart from scientific observations, other recurring and pre-defined activities
will be performed onto the payload. The SOC will contact the GCS by e-mail or
phone whenever one of these activities is to be performed to coordinate a time slot,
and after that the GCS will send a request through the C&C channel. Before the launch
of the satellite (or during IOT), a unique procedure will be designed, checked and
verified for every activity. These procedures include a section with inputs from
the SOC, as explained hereinafter.

These activities include:


### 1. Decontamination

Activity in which the detector is heated in order to remove contaminations that may
impact the image quality. The frequency of this operation is TBD and each activity
will last for TBD days. Each time this activity is performed, the SOC will provide
with a start time for the activity and the required duration.


### 2. Focusing

The focusing mechanism on the payload should be used in order to focus the optics
whenever the SOC detects a decline in image quality. Focusing will be probably performed
during IOT. Prior to the launch, it is not clear if this activity will need to be
performed again during the mission at all.

The general procedure for this operation is TBD by the SOC.


### 3. Dark current imaging

This activity will be performed only during the IOT (TBD), while the TCD is closed.
The goal is to obtain the dark current of the detector when no light is entering the
telescope, to use as part of the scientific image processing during the mission.
In order to obtain a wide selection of dark images, several exposure times will be used.
In addition, the SOC will probably request to obtain images at varying temperatures of
the detector (TBD). Each time this activity is performed, the SOC will provide with a
start time for the activity, the required amount if images to be obtained, and its
parameters (exposure duration, detector temperature (TBD))


### 4. Bias imaging

This activity will be performed in order to measure the quality of the detector at
exposure times of 0 seconds, to be used during image processing. This activity will
be performed at a frequency of TBD.
Each time this activity is performed, the SOC will provide with a start time for the
activity, the required number of images to be obtained, and any other imaging parameter needed.
After each activity is performed, all relevant results will be delivered to the SOC for analysis.
The SOC may decide to perform additional, follow-up activities, after the analysis.
