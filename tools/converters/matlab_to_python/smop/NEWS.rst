December 24, 2017
    Version 0.38 will contain the port to
    python3.

December 3, 2016
    Version 0.34 is out

    Workaround: parfor is handled as plain for.

    New option -c --code 
        Quickly check how a particular statement
        is translated. Option -c implies -o- .

    Renamed option -D to -d (--debug).

    New regression count:

        $ cd libscripts && make regresss

    Currently 14 regressions

        
November 18, 2016
    Version 0.31 is out

    Changed naming of output files.
        If -o not specified, compiling foo.m
	now results in foo.py

    Using octave script library for testing
        $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ftp/octave/octave-4.0.2.tar.gz
	$ smop -a octave-4.0.2.tar.gz -g '*/scripts/*.m'
	$ ls -1 *.py | wc
	$ python -m py_compile *.py
	$ ls -1 *.pyc | wc

    New option -a --archive allows to get data from
        tar file, without extracting the contents
	to a temporary place.

    New option -g --glob-pattern allows to limit
        the amount of input data

    Removed option --ignore-errors.
        All errors are ignored now.

    Version 0.29 is out

    Test suite for regression testing is ready,
        with about 1000 m-scripts.  Scripts are translated
        to python, then the resulting py-files are loaded,
        but not yet run.

    Version 0.28 is out. 

    Line numbering information is included in the output.
        Enabled by default.  Disabled with ``--no-numbers``.

    Block comments are preserved now.
        Lines, containing anything but a comment, are
        preserved. Enabled by default.
        Disabled with ``--no-comments``.

    New command-line options
        ``--no-resolve,--no-backend`` useful mostly for
        debugging. New shortcuts -R -B -T -C -N
        
    Special ``%!`` comments are partially supported now.
        They are mostly useful in testing, and
        are used by Octave library and test suite. Disabled
        by default. Enabled with ``--testing-mode``.

   After a year-long vacation I am back to active development.
   My first goal is adopting the Octave runtime and test suite.

October 23, 2014
   Downloaded ``mybench`` -- a collection of 20 or so
   micro-benchmarks originally meant to compare matlab and
   octave performance.  After succesfully running the first nine,
   the geometric mean of the speedup is 0.36,  which is cool.

   Version 0.26.3 is available for beta testing.
   Next version 0.27 is planned to compile octave
   ``scripts`` library, which contains over 120 KLOC in
   almost 1,000 matlab files. There  are 13 compilation
   errors with smop 0.26.3 .
