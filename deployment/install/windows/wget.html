<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wget &minus;
The non&minus;interactive network downloader.</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">wget
[<i>option</i>]... [ <i><small>URL</small></i> ]...</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>GNU</small>
Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files
from the Web. It supports <small>HTTP, HTTPS,</small> and
<small>FTP</small> protocols, as well as retrieval through
<small>HTTP</small> proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wget is
non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on. This allows you to start a
retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget
finish the work. By contrast, most of the Web browsers
require constant user&rsquo;s presence, which can be a great
hindrance when transferring a lot of data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wget can follow
links in <small>HTML, XHTML,</small> and <small>CSS</small>
pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully
recreating the directory structure of the original site.
This is sometimes referred to as &quot;recursive
downloading.&quot; While doing that, Wget respects the Robot
Exclusion Standard (<i>/robots.txt</i>). Wget can be
instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point
at the local files, for offline viewing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wget has been
designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
connections; if a download fails due to a network problem,
it will keep retrying until the whole file has been
retrieved. If the server supports regetting, it will
instruct the server to continue the download from where it
left off.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Option
Syntax</b> <br>
Since Wget uses <small>GNU</small> getopt to process
command-line arguments, every option has a long form along
with the short one. Long options are more convenient to
remember, but take time to type. You may freely mix
different option styles, or specify options after the
command-line arguments. Thus you may write:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">wget -r
--tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o
log</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The space
between the option accepting an argument and the argument
may be omitted. Instead of <b>-o log</b> you can write
<b>-olog</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may put
several options that do not require arguments together,
like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">wget -drc
&lt;URL&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
completely equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">wget -d
-r -c &lt;URL&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the
options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with <b>--</b>. So the following
will try to download <small>URL</small> <b>-x</b>,
reporting failure to <i>log</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">wget -o
log -- -x</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options
that accept comma-separated lists all respect the convention
that specifying an empty list clears its value. This can be
useful to clear the <i>.wgetrc</i> settings. For instance,
if your <i>.wgetrc</i> sets &quot;exclude_directories&quot;
to <i>/cgi-bin</i>, the following example will first
reset it, and then set it to exclude <i>/~nobody</i> and
<i>/~somebody</i>. You can also clear the lists in
<i>.wgetrc</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">wget -X
&quot;&quot; -X /~nobody,/~somebody</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most options
that do not accept arguments are <i>boolean</i> options, so
named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no
(&quot;boolean&quot;) variable. For example,
<b>--follow-ftp</b> tells Wget to follow
<small>FTP</small> links from <small>HTML</small> files and,
on the other hand, <b>--no-glob</b> tells
it not to perform file globbing on <small>FTP</small> URLs.
A boolean option is either <i>affirmative</i> or
<i>negative</i> (beginning with <b>--no</b>).
All such options share several properties.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless stated
otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is the
opposite of what the option accomplishes. For example, the
documented existence of
<b>--follow-ftp</b> assumes that the
default is to <i>not</i> follow <small>FTP</small> links
from <small>HTML</small> pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Affirmative
options can be negated by prepending the
<b>--no-</b> to the option name; negative
options can be negated by omitting the
<b>--no-</b> prefix. This might seem
superfluous---if the default for an
affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide
a way to explicitly turn it off? But the startup file may in
fact change the default. For instance, using
&quot;follow_ftp = on&quot; in <i>.wgetrc</i> makes Wget
<i>follow</i> <small>FTP</small> links by default, and using
<b>--no-follow-ftp</b> is the only
way to restore the factory default from the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--background</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Go to background immediately
after startup. If no output file is specified via the
<b>-o</b>, output is redirected to
<i>wget-log</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-e</b> <i>command</i>
<b><br>
--execute</b> <i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Execute <i>command</i> as if it
were a part of <i>.wgetrc</i>. A command thus invoked will
be executed <i>after</i> the commands in <i>.wgetrc</i>,
thus taking precedence over them. If you need to specify
more than one wgetrc command, use multiple instances of
<b>-e</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Logging and

standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-a</b> <i>logfile</i>
<b><br>
--append-output=</b><i>logfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Append to <i>logfile</i>. This
is the same as <b>-o</b>, only it appends to
<i>logfile</i> instead of overwriting the old log file. If
<i>logfile</i> does not exist, a new file is created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--debug</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn on debug output, meaning
various information important to the developers of Wget if
it does not work properly. Your system administrator may
have chosen to compile Wget without debug support, in which
case <b>-d</b> will not work. Please note that
compiling with debug support is always
safe---Wget compiled with the debug
support will <i>not</i> print any debug info unless
requested with <b>-d</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn off verbose without being
completely quiet (use <b>-q</b> for that), which means
that error messages and basic information still get
printed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--report-speed=</b><i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output bandwidth as
<i>type</i>. The only accepted value is <b>bits</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b> <i>file</i>
<b><br>
--input-file=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Read URLs from a local or
external <i>file</i>. If <b>-</b> is specified as
<i>file</i>, URLs are read from the standard input. (Use
<b>./-</b> to read from a file literally named
<b>-</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this
function is used, no URLs need be present on the command
line. If there are URLs both on the command line and in an
input file, those on the command lines will be the first
ones to be retrieved. If
<b>--force-html</b> is not specified, then
<i>file</i> should consist of a series of URLs, one per
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
specify <b>--force-html</b>, the document
will be regarded as <b>html</b>. In that case you may have
problems with relative links, which you can solve either by
adding &quot;&lt;base href=&quot;<i>url</i>&quot;&gt;&quot;
to the documents or by specifying
<b>--base=</b><i>url</i> on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<i>file</i> is an external one, the document will be
automatically treated as <b>html</b> if the Content-Type
matches <b>text/html</b>. Furthermore, the
<i>file</i>&rsquo;s location will be implicitly used as base
href if none was specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--input-metalink=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Downloads files covered in
local Metalink <i>file</i>. Metalink version 3 and 4 are
supported.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--keep-badhash</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Keeps downloaded
Metalink&rsquo;s files with a bad hash. It appends .badhash
to the name of Metalink&rsquo;s files which have a checksum
mismatch, except without overwriting existing files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--metalink-over-http</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Issues <small>HTTP HEAD</small>
request instead of <small>GET</small> and extracts Metalink
metadata from response headers. Then it switches to Metalink
download. If no valid Metalink metadata is found, it falls
back to ordinary <small>HTTP</small> download. Enables
<b>Content-Type: application/metalink4+xml</b> files
download/processing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--metalink-index=</b><i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the Metalink
<b>application/metalink4+xml</b> metaurl ordinal
<small>NUMBER.</small> From 1 to the total number of
&quot;application/metalink4+xml&quot; available. Specify 0
or <b>inf</b> to choose the first good one. Metaurls, such
as those from a
<b>--metalink-over-http</b>, may
have been sorted by priority key&rsquo;s value; keep this in
mind to choose the right <small>NUMBER.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--preferred-location</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set preferred location for
Metalink resources. This has effect if multiple resources
with same priority are available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--xattr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable use of file
system&rsquo;s extended attributes to save the original
<small>URL</small> and the Referer <small>HTTP</small>
header value if used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Be aware that
the <small>URL</small> might contain private information
like access tokens or credentials.</p>

<p><b>-F</b></p></td>
<td width="86%">
</td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--force-html</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When input is read from a file,
force it to be treated as an <small>HTML</small> file. This
enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
<small>HTML</small> files on your local disk, by adding
&quot;&lt;base href=&quot;<i>url</i>&quot;&gt;&quot; to
<small>HTML,</small> or using the <b>--base</b>
command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-B</b>
<i><small>URL</small></i> <b><br>
--base=</b> <i><small>URL</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Resolves relative links using
<i><small>URL</small></i> as the point of reference, when
reading links from an <small>HTML</small> file specified via
the <b>-i</b>/<b>--input-file</b>
option (together with <b>--force-html</b>,
or when the input file was fetched remotely from a server
describing it as <small>HTML</small> ). This is equivalent
to the presence of a &quot;BASE&quot; tag in the
<small>HTML</small> input file, with
<i><small>URL</small></i> as the value for the
&quot;href&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For instance,
if you specify <b>http://foo/bar/a.html</b> for
<i><small>URL</small></i> , and Wget reads
<b>../baz/b.html</b> from the input file, it would be
resolved to <b>http://foo/baz/b.html</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--config=</b>
<i><small>FILE</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the location of a
startup file you wish to use instead of the default one(s).
Use --no-config to disable reading of
config files. If both --config and
--no-config are given,
--no-config is ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--rejected-log=</b><i>logfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Logs all <small>URL</small>
rejections to <i>logfile</i> as comma separated values. The
values include the reason of rejection, the
<small>URL</small> and the parent <small>URL</small> it was
found in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Download
Options <br>
--bind-address=</b>
<i><small>ADDRESS</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When making client
<small>TCP/IP</small> connections, bind to
<i><small>ADDRESS</small></i> on the local machine.
<i><small>ADDRESS</small></i> may be specified as a hostname
or <small>IP</small> address. This option can be useful if
your machine is bound to multiple IPs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--bind-dns-address=</b>
<i><small>ADDRESS</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">[libcares only] This address
overrides the route for <small>DNS</small> requests. If you
ever need to circumvent the standard settings from
/etc/resolv.conf, this option together with
<b>--dns-servers</b> is your friend.
<i><small>ADDRESS</small></i> must be specified either as
IPv4 or IPv6 address. Wget needs to be built with libcares
for this option to be available.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--dns-servers=</b>
<i><small>ADDRESSES</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">[libcares only] The given
address(es) override the standard nameserver addresses, e.g.
as configured in /etc/resolv.conf.
<i><small>ADDRESSES</small></i> may be specified either as
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, comma-separated. Wget needs to be
built with libcares for this option to be available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b> <i>number</i>
<b><br>
--tries=</b><i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set number of tries to
<i>number</i>. Specify 0 or <b>inf</b> for infinite
retrying. The default is to retry 20 times, with the
exception of fatal errors like &quot;connection
refused&quot; or &quot;not found&quot; (404), which are not
retried.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-O</b> <i>file</i>
<b><br>
--output-document=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The documents will not be
written to the appropriate files, but all will be
concatenated together and written to <i>file</i>. If
<b>-</b> is used as <i>file</i>, documents will be
printed to standard output, disabling link conversion. (Use
<b>./-</b> to print to a file literally named
<b>-</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use of
<b>-O</b> is <i>not</i> intended to mean simply
&quot;use the name <i>file</i> instead of the one in the
<small>URL</small> ;&quot; rather, it is analogous to shell
redirection: <b>wget -O file http://foo</b> is
intended to work like <b>wget -O - http://foo
&gt; file</b>; <i>file</i> will be truncated immediately,
and <i>all</i> downloaded content will be written there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For this
reason, <b>-N</b> (for timestamp-checking) is not
supported in combination with <b>-O</b>: since
<i>file</i> is always newly created, it will always have a
very new timestamp. A warning will be issued if this
combination is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
using <b>-r</b> or <b>-p</b> with
<b>-O</b> may not work as you expect: Wget won&rsquo;t
just download the first file to <i>file</i> and then
download the rest to their normal names: <i>all</i>
downloaded content will be placed in <i>file</i>. This was
disabled in version 1.11, but has been reinstated (with a
warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some cases where this
behavior can actually have some use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A combination
with <b>-nc</b> is only accepted if the given output
file does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
combination with <b>-k</b> is only permitted when
downloading a single document, as in that case it will just
convert all relative URIs to external ones; <b>-k</b>
makes no sense for multiple URIs when they&rsquo;re all
being downloaded to a single file; <b>-k</b> can be
used only when the output is a regular file.</p>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-clobber</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a file is downloaded more
than once in the same directory, Wget&rsquo;s behavior
depends on a few options, including <b>-nc</b>. In
certain cases, the local file will be <i>clobbered</i>, or
overwritten, upon repeated download. In other cases it will
be preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When running
Wget without <b>-N</b>, <b>-nc</b>,
<b>-r</b>, or <b>-p</b>, downloading the same
file in the same directory will result in the original copy
of <i>file</i> being preserved and the second copy being
named <i>file</i><b>.1</b>. If that file is downloaded yet
again, the third copy will be named <i>file</i><b>.2</b>,
and so on. (This is also the behavior with <b>-nd</b>,
even if <b>-r</b> or <b>-p</b> are in effect.)
When <b>-nc</b> is specified, this behavior is
suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of
<i>file</i>. Therefore,
&quot;&quot;no-clobber&quot;&quot; is actually a
misnomer in this mode---it&rsquo;s not
clobbering that&rsquo;s prevented (as the numeric suffixes
were already preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple
version saving that&rsquo;s prevented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When running
Wget with <b>-r</b> or <b>-p</b>, but without
<b>-N</b>, <b>-nd</b>, or <b>-nc</b>,
re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply
overwriting the old. Adding <b>-nc</b> will prevent
this behavior, instead causing the original version to be
preserved and any newer copies on the server to be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When running
Wget with <b>-N</b>, with or without <b>-r</b>
or <b>-p</b>, the decision as to whether or not to
download a newer copy of a file depends on the local and
remote timestamp and size of the file. <b>-nc</b> may
not be specified at the same time as <b>-N</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A combination
with
<b>-O</b>/<b>--output-document</b>
is only accepted if the given output file does not
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
<b>-nc</b> is specified, files with the suffixes
<b>.html</b> or <b>.htm</b> will be loaded from the local
disk and parsed as if they had been retrieved from the
Web.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--backups=</b><i>backups</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Before (over)writing a file,
back up an existing file by adding a <b>.1</b> suffix
(<b>_1</b> on <small>VMS</small> ) to the file name. Such
backup files are rotated to <b>.2</b>, <b>.3</b>, and so on,
up to <i>backups</i> (and lost beyond that).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-netrc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not try to obtain
credentials from <i>.netrc</i> file. By default
<i>.netrc</i> file is searched for credentials in case none
have been passed on command line and authentication is
required.</p>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--continue</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Continue getting a
partially-downloaded file. This is useful when you want to
finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget,
or by another program. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -c
ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If there is a
file named <i>ls-lR.Z</i> in the current directory,
Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote
file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from
an offset equal to the length of the local file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
don&rsquo;t need to specify this option if you just want the
current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file
should the connection be lost midway through. This is the
default behavior. <b>-c</b> only affects resumption of
downloads started <i>prior</i> to this invocation of Wget,
and whose local files are still sitting around.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without
<b>-c</b>, the previous example would just download
the remote file to <i>ls-lR.Z.1</i>, leaving the
truncated <i>ls-lR.Z</i> file alone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you use
<b>-c</b> on a non-empty file, and the server does not
support continued downloading, Wget will restart the
download from scratch and overwrite the existing file
entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Beginning with
Wget 1.7, if you use <b>-c</b> on a file which is of
equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to
download the file and print an explanatory message. The same
happens when the file is smaller on the server than locally
(presumably because it was changed on the server since your
last download attempt)---because
&quot;continuing&quot; is not meaningful, no download
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
side of the coin, while using <b>-c</b>, any file
that&rsquo;s bigger on the server than locally will be
considered an incomplete download and only
&quot;(length(remote) - length(local))&quot; bytes
will be downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local
file. This behavior can be desirable in certain
cases---for instance, you can use <b>wget
-c</b> to download just the new portion that&rsquo;s
been appended to a data collection or log file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, if the
file is bigger on the server because it&rsquo;s been
<i>changed</i>, as opposed to just <i>appended</i> to,
you&rsquo;ll end up with a garbled file. Wget has no way of
verifying that the local file is really a valid prefix of
the remote file. You need to be especially careful of this
when using <b>-c</b> in conjunction with
<b>-r</b>, since every file will be considered as an
&quot;incomplete download&quot; candidate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another
instance where you&rsquo;ll get a garbled file if you try to
use <b>-c</b> is if you have a lame
<small>HTTP</small> proxy that inserts a &quot;transfer
interrupted&quot; string into the local file. In the future
a &quot;rollback&quot; option may be added to deal with this
case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>-c</b> only works with <small>FTP</small> servers
and with <small>HTTP</small> servers that support the
&quot;Range&quot; header.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--start-pos=</b>
<i><small>OFFSET</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Start downloading at zero-based
position <i><small>OFFSET</small></i> . Offset may be
expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the &lsquo;k&rsquo;
suffix, or megabytes with the &lsquo;m&rsquo; suffix,
etc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--start-pos</b>
has higher precedence over <b>--continue</b>.
When <b>--start-pos</b> and
<b>--continue</b> are both specified, wget will
emit a warning then proceed as if
<b>--continue</b> was absent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Server support
for continued download is required, otherwise
<b>--start-pos</b> cannot help. See
<b>-c</b> for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--progress=</b><i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Select the type of the progress
indicator you wish to use. Legal indicators are
&quot;dot&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;bar&quot; indicator is used by default. It draws an
<small>ASCII</small> progress bar graphics (a.k.a
&quot;thermometer&quot; display) indicating the status of
retrieval. If the output is not a <small>TTY,</small> the
&quot;dot&quot; bar will be used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>--progress=dot</b> to switch to the
&quot;dot&quot; display. It traces the retrieval by printing
dots on the screen, each dot representing a fixed amount of
downloaded data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The progress
<i>type</i> can also take one or more parameters. The
parameters vary based on the <i>type</i> selected.
Parameters to <i>type</i> are passed by appending them to
the type sperated by a colon (:) like this:
<b>--progress=</b><i>type</i><b>:</b><i>parameter1</i><b>:</b><i>parameter2</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
dotted retrieval, you may set the <i>style</i> by specifying
the type as <b>dot:</b><i>style</i>. Different styles assign
different meaning to one dot. With the &quot;default&quot;
style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots in a
cluster and 50 dots in a line. The &quot;binary&quot; style
has a more &quot;computer&quot;-like
orientation---8K dots, 16-dots
clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K lines).
The &quot;mega&quot; style is suitable for downloading large
files---each dot represents 64K retrieved,
there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line
(so each line contains 3M). If &quot;mega&quot; is not
enough then you can use the &quot;giga&quot;
style---each dot represents 1M retrieved,
there are eight dots in a cluster, and 32 dots on each line
(so each line contains 32M).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>--progress=bar</b>, there are currently two
possible parameters, <i>force</i> and <i>noscroll</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the output
is not a <small>TTY,</small> the progress bar always falls
back to &quot;dot&quot;, even if
<b>--progress=bar</b> was passed to Wget during
invocation. This behaviour can be overridden and the
&quot;bar&quot; output forced by using the &quot;force&quot;
parameter as <b>--progress=bar:force</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
<b>bar</b> style progress bar scroll the name of the file
from left to right for the file being downloaded if the
filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its
display. In certain cases, such as with
<b>--progress=bar:force</b>, one may not want
the scrolling filename in the progress bar. By passing the
&quot;noscroll&quot; parameter, Wget can be forced to
display as much of the filename as possible without
scrolling through it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can set the default style using the &quot;progress&quot;
command in <i>.wgetrc</i>. That setting may be overridden
from the command line. For example, to force the bar output
without scrolling, use
<b>--progress=bar:force:noscroll</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--show-progress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Force wget to display the
progress bar in any verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
wget only displays the progress bar in verbose mode. One may
however, want wget to display the progress bar on screen in
conjunction with any other verbosity modes like
<b>--no-verbose</b> or
<b>--quiet</b>. This is often a desired a
property when invoking wget to download several small/large
files. In such a case, wget could simply be invoked with
this parameter to get a much cleaner output on the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
will also force the progress bar to be printed to
<i>stderr</i> when used alongside the
<b>--output-file</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not send If-Modified-Since

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-use-server-timestamps</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t set the local
file&rsquo;s timestamp by the one on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
when a file is downloaded, its timestamps are set to match
those from the remote file. This allows the use of
<b>--timestamping</b> on subsequent invocations
of wget. However, it is sometimes useful to base the local
file&rsquo;s timestamp on when it was actually downloaded;
for that purpose, the
<b>--no-use-server-timestamps</b>
option has been provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print the headers sent by
<small>HTTP</small> servers and responses sent by
<small>FTP</small> servers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--spider</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When invoked with this option,
Wget will behave as a Web <i>spider</i>, which means that it
will not download the pages, just check that they are there.
For example, you can use Wget to check your bookmarks:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget
--spider --force-html -i
bookmarks.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This feature
needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
functionality of real web spiders.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-T seconds <br>
--timeout=</b><i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the network timeout to
<i>seconds</i> seconds. This is equivalent to specifying
<b>--dns-timeout</b>,
<b>--connect-timeout</b>, and
<b>--read-timeout</b>, all at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and
abort the operation if it takes too long. This prevents
anomalies like hanging reads and infinite connects. The only
timeout enabled by default is a 900-second read
timeout. Setting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether.
Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to change
the default timeout settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All
timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
subsecond values. For example, <b>0.1</b> seconds is a legal
(though unwise) choice of timeout. Subsecond timeouts are
useful for checking server response times or for testing
network latency.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--dns-timeout=</b><i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the <small>DNS</small>
lookup timeout to <i>seconds</i> seconds. <small>DNS</small>
lookups that don&rsquo;t complete within the specified time
will fail. By default, there is no timeout on
<small>DNS</small> lookups, other than that implemented by
system libraries.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--connect-timeout=</b><i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the connect timeout to
<i>seconds</i> seconds. <small>TCP</small> connections that
take longer to establish will be aborted. By default, there
is no connect timeout, other than that implemented by system
libraries.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--read-timeout=</b><i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the read (and write)
timeout to <i>seconds</i> seconds. The &quot;time&quot; of
this timeout refers to <i>idle time</i>: if, at any point in
the download, no data is received for more than the
specified number of seconds, reading fails and the download
is restarted. This option does not directly affect the
duration of the entire download.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Of course, the
remote server may choose to terminate the connection sooner
than this option requires. The default read timeout is 900
seconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--limit-rate=</b><i>amount</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the download speed to
<i>amount</i> bytes per second. Amount may be expressed in
bytes, kilobytes with the <b>k</b> suffix, or megabytes with
the <b>m</b> suffix. For example,
<b>--limit-rate=20k</b> will limit the
retrieval rate to 20KB/s. This is useful when, for whatever
reason, you don&rsquo;t want Wget to consume the entire
available bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in conjunction
with power suffixes; for example,
<b>--limit-rate=2.5k</b> is a legal
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that Wget
implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate amount
of time after a network read that took less time than
specified by the rate. Eventually this strategy causes the
<small>TCP</small> transfer to slow down to approximately
the specified rate. However, it may take some time for this
balance to be achieved, so don&rsquo;t be surprised if
limiting the rate doesn&rsquo;t work well with very small
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-w</b> <i>seconds</i>
<b><br>
--wait=</b><i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Wait the specified number of
seconds between the retrievals. Use of this option is
recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the
requests less frequent. Instead of in seconds, the time can
be specified in minutes using the &quot;m&quot; suffix, in
hours using &quot;h&quot; suffix, or in days using
&quot;d&quot; suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying a
large value for this option is useful if the network or the
destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough
to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before
the retry. The waiting interval specified by this function
is influenced by
&quot;--random-wait&quot;, which see.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--waitretry=</b><i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you don&rsquo;t want Wget to
wait between <i>every</i> retrieval, but only between
retries of failed downloads, you can use this option. Wget
will use <i>linear backoff</i>, waiting 1 second after the
first failure on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after
the second failure on that file, up to the maximum number of
<i>seconds</i> you specify.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--random-wait</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some web sites may perform log
analysis to identify retrieval programs such as Wget by
looking for statistically significant similarities in the
time between requests. This option causes the time between
requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * <i>wait</i> seconds,
where <i>wait</i> was specified using the
<b>--wait</b> option, in order to mask
Wget&rsquo;s presence from such analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A 2001 article
in a publication devoted to development on a popular
consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on
the fly. Its author suggested blocking at the class C
address level to ensure automated retrieval programs were
blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>--random-wait</b> option was inspired
by this ill-advised recommendation to block many unrelated
users from a web site due to the actions of one.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-proxy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t use proxies, even
if the appropriate *_proxy environment variable is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-Q</b> <i>quota</i>
<b><br>
--quota=</b><i>quota</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify download quota for
automatic retrievals. The value can be specified in bytes
(default), kilobytes (with <b>k</b> suffix), or megabytes
(with <b>m</b> suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that quota
will never affect downloading a single file. So if you
specify <b>wget -Q10k
https://example.com/ls-lR.gz</b>, all of the
<i>ls-lR.gz</i> will be downloaded. The same goes even
when several URLs are specified on the command-line. The
quota is checked only at the end of each downloaded file, so
it will never result in a partially downloaded file. Thus
you may safely type <b>wget -Q2m -i
sites</b>---download will be aborted after
the file that exhausts the quota is completely
downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Setting quota
to 0 or to <b>inf</b> unlimits the download quota.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-dns-cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn off caching of
<small>DNS</small> lookups. Normally, Wget remembers the
<small>IP</small> addresses it looked up from
<small>DNS</small> so it doesn&rsquo;t have to repeatedly
contact the <small>DNS</small> server for the same
(typically small) set of hosts it retrieves from. This cache
exists in memory only; a new Wget run will contact
<small>DNS</small> again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, it has
been reported that in some situations it is not desirable to
cache host names, even for the duration of a short-running
application like Wget. With this option Wget issues a new
<small>DNS</small> lookup (more precisely, a new call to
&quot;gethostbyname&quot; or &quot;getaddrinfo&quot;) each
time it makes a new connection. Please note that this option
will <i>not</i> affect caching that might be performed by
the resolving library or by an external caching layer, such
as <small>NSCD.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t understand exactly what this option does, you
probably won&rsquo;t need it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--restrict-file-names=</b><i>modes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Change which characters found
in remote URLs must be escaped during generation of local
filenames. Characters that are <i>restricted</i> by this
option are escaped, i.e. replaced with <b>%HH</b>, where
<b><small>HH</small></b> is the hexadecimal number that
corresponds to the restricted character. This option may
also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be either
lower- or uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe as
part of file names on your operating system, as well as
control characters that are typically unprintable. This
option is useful for changing these defaults, perhaps
because you are downloading to a non-native partition, or
because you want to disable escaping of the control
characters, or you want to further restrict characters to
only those in the <small>ASCII</small> range of values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>modes</i> are a comma-separated set of text values. The
acceptable values are <b>unix</b>, <b>windows</b>,
<b>nocontrol</b>, <b>ascii</b>, <b>lowercase</b>, and
<b>uppercase</b>. The values <b>unix</b> and <b>windows</b>
are mutually exclusive (one will override the other), as are
<b>lowercase</b> and <b>uppercase</b>. Those last are
special cases, as they do not change the set of characters
that would be escaped, but rather force local file paths to
be converted either to lower- or uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
&quot;unix&quot; is specified, Wget escapes the character
<b>/</b> and the control characters in the ranges
0--31 and 128--159. This is the
default on Unix-like operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
&quot;windows&quot; is given, Wget escapes the characters
<b>\</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>/</b>, <b>:</b>, <b>?</b>,
<b>&quot;</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, and the
control characters in the ranges 0--31 and
128--159. In addition to this, Wget in Windows
mode uses <b>+</b> instead of <b>:</b> to separate host and
port in local file names, and uses <b>@</b> instead of
<b>?</b> to separate the query portion of the file name from
the rest. Therefore, a <small>URL</small> that would be
saved as <b>www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah</b> in
Unix mode would be saved as
<b>www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah</b> in Windows
mode. This mode is the default on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
<b>nocontrol</b>, then the escaping of the control
characters is also switched off. This option may make sense
when you are downloading URLs whose names contain
<small>UTF-8</small> characters, on a system which can
save and display filenames in <small>UTF-8</small>
(some possible byte values used in
<small>UTF-8</small> byte sequences fall in the range
of values designated by Wget as &quot;controls&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ascii</b> mode is used to specify that any bytes whose
values are outside the range of <small>ASCII</small>
characters (that is, greater than 127) shall be escaped.
This can be useful when saving filenames whose encoding does
not match the one used locally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--inet6-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Force connecting to IPv4 or
IPv6 addresses. With <b>--inet4-only</b>
or <b>-4</b>, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts,
ignoring <small>AAAA</small> records in <small>DNS,</small>
and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses specified in URLs.
Conversely, with <b>--inet6-only</b> or
<b>-6</b>, Wget will only connect to IPv6 hosts and
ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Neither options
should be needed normally. By default, an IPv6-aware
Wget will use the address family specified by the
host&rsquo;s <small>DNS</small> record. If the
<small>DNS</small> responds with both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one
it can connect to. (Also see
&quot;--prefer-family&quot; option
described below.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These options
can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or IPv6
address families on dual family systems, usually to aid
debugging or to deal with broken network configuration. Only
one of <b>--inet6-only</b> and
<b>--inet4-only</b> may be specified at
the same time. Neither option is available in Wget compiled
without IPv6 support.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When given a choice of several
addresses, connect to the addresses with specified address
family first. The address order returned by
<small>DNS</small> is used without change by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This avoids
spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing hosts
that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4
networks. For example, <b>www.kame.net</b> resolves to
<b>2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085</b> and to
<b>203.178.141.194</b>. When the preferred family is
&quot;IPv4&quot;, the IPv4 address is used first; when the
preferred family is &quot;IPv6&quot;, the IPv6 address is
used first; if the specified value is &quot;none&quot;, the
address order returned by <small>DNS</small> is used without
change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike
<b>-4</b> and <b>-6</b>, this option
doesn&rsquo;t inhibit access to any address family, it only
changes the <i>order</i> in which the addresses are
accessed. Also note that the reordering performed by this
option is <i>stable</i>---it doesn&rsquo;t
affect order of addresses of the same family. That is, the
relative order of all IPv4 addresses and of all IPv6
addresses remains intact in all cases.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--retry-connrefused</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider &quot;connection
refused&quot; a transient error and try again. Normally Wget
gives up on a <small>URL</small> when it is unable to
connect to the site because failure to connect is taken as a
sign that the server is not running at all and that retries
would not help. This option is for mirroring unreliable
sites whose servers tend to disappear for short periods of
time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--user=</b><i>user</i>
<b><br>
--password=</b><i>password</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the username
<i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> for both
<small>FTP</small> and <small>HTTP</small> file retrieval.
These parameters can be overridden using the
<b>--ftp-user</b> and
<b>--ftp-password</b> options for
<small>FTP</small> connections and the
<b>--http-user</b> and
<b>--http-password</b> options for
<small>HTTP</small> connections.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ask-password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prompt for a password for each
connection established. Cannot be specified when
<b>--password</b> is being used, because they
are mutually exclusive.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--use-askpass=</b><i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prompt for a user and password
using the specified command. If no command is specified then
the command in the environment variable
<small>WGET_ASKPASS</small> is used. If
<small>WGET_ASKPASS</small> is not set then the command in
the environment variable <small>SSH_ASKPASS</small> is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can set the
default command for use-askpass in the <i>.wgetrc</i>. That
setting may be overridden from the command line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-iri</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn off internationalized
<small>URI</small> ( <small>IRI</small> ) support. Use
<b>--iri</b> to turn it on. <small>IRI</small>
support is activated by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can set the
default state of <small>IRI</small> support using the
&quot;iri&quot; command in <i>.wgetrc</i>. That setting may
be overridden from the command line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--local-encoding=</b><i>encoding</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Force Wget to use
<i>encoding</i> as the default system encoding. That affects
how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments from locale to
<small>UTF-8</small> for <small>IRI</small>
support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Wget use the
function &quot;nl_langinfo()&quot; and then the
&quot;CHARSET&quot; environment variable to get the locale.
If it fails, <small>ASCII</small> is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can set the
default local encoding using the &quot;local_encoding&quot;
command in <i>.wgetrc</i>. That setting may be overridden
from the command line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--remote-encoding=</b><i>encoding</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Force Wget to use
<i>encoding</i> as the default remote server encoding. That
affects how Wget converts URIs found in files from remote
encoding to <small>UTF-8</small> during a recursive
fetch. This options is only useful for <small>IRI</small>
support, for the interpretation of non-ASCII characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For
<small>HTTP,</small> remote encoding can be found in
<small>HTTP</small> &quot;Content-Type&quot; header
and in <small>HTML</small> &quot;Content-Type
http-equiv&quot; meta tag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can set the
default encoding using the &quot;remoteencoding&quot;
command in <i>.wgetrc</i>. That setting may be overridden
from the command line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--unlink</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Force Wget to unlink file
instead of clobbering existing file. This option is useful
for downloading to the directory with hardlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Directory
Options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-directories</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not create a hierarchy of
directories when retrieving recursively. With this option
turned on, all files will get saved to the current
directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up more than
once, the filenames will get extensions <b>.n</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--force-directories</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The opposite of
<b>-nd</b>---create a hierarchy of
directories, even if one would not have been created
otherwise. E.g. <b>wget -x
http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt</b> will save the
downloaded file to <i>fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt</i>.</p>

<td width="85%">

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-host-directories</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable generation of
host-prefixed directories. By default, invoking Wget with
<b>-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</b> will create a
structure of directories beginning with
<i>fly.srk.fer.hr/</i>. This option disables such
behavior.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--protocol-directories</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the protocol name as a
directory component of local file names. For example, with
this option, <b>wget -r http://</b><i>host</i> will
save to <b>http/</b><i>host</i><b>/...</b> rather than just
to <i>host</i><b>/...</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--cut-dirs=</b><i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore <i>number</i> directory
components. This is useful for getting a fine-grained
control over the directory where recursive retrieval will be
saved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Take, for
example, the directory at
<b>ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</b>. If you retrieve it
with <b>-r</b>, it will be saved locally under
<i>ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</i>. While the
<b>-nH</b> option can remove the
<i>ftp.xemacs.org/</i> part, you are still stuck with
<i>pub/xemacs</i>. This is where
<b>--cut-dirs</b> comes in handy; it makes
Wget not &quot;see&quot; <i>number</i> remote directory
components. Here are several examples of how
<b>--cut-dirs</b> option works.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">No options
-&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/ <br>
-nH -&gt; pub/xemacs/ <br>
-nH --cut-dirs=1 -&gt; xemacs/
<br>
-nH --cut-dirs=2 -&gt; . <br>
--cut-dirs=1 -&gt;
ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/ <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you just
want to get rid of the directory structure, this option is
similar to a combination of <b>-nd</b> and
<b>-P</b>. However, unlike <b>-nd</b>,
<b>--cut-dirs</b> does not lose with
subdirectories---for instance, with
<b>-nH --cut-dirs=1</b>, a
<i>beta/</i> subdirectory will be placed to
<i>xemacs/beta</i>, as one would expect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-P</b> <i>prefix</i>
<b><br>
--directory-prefix=</b><i>prefix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set directory prefix to
<i>prefix</i>. The <i>directory prefix</i> is the directory
where all other files and subdirectories will be saved to,
i.e. the top of the retrieval tree. The default is <b>.</b>
(the current directory).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>HTTP</small>
Options <br>
--default-page=</b><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use <i>name</i> as the default
file name when it isn&rsquo;t known (i.e., for URLs that end
in a slash), instead of <i>index.html</i>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p><b>-E</b></p></td>
<td width="86%">
</td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--adjust-extension</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a file of type
<b>application/xhtml+xml</b> or <b>text/html</b> is
downloaded and the <small>URL</small> does not end with the
regexp <b>\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?</b>, this option will cause
the suffix <b>.html</b> to be appended to the local
filename. This is useful, for instance, when you&rsquo;re
mirroring a remote site that uses <b>.asp</b> pages, but you
want the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache
server. Another good use for this is when you&rsquo;re
downloading CGI-generated materials. A <small>URL</small>
like <b>http://site.com/article.cgi?25</b> will be saved as
<i>article.cgi?25.html</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every
time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can&rsquo;t tell
that the local <i>X.html</i> file corresponds to remote
<small>URL</small> <i>X</i> (since it doesn&rsquo;t yet know
that the <small>URL</small> produces output of type
<b>text/html</b> or <b>application/xhtml+xml</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of version
1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files of
type <b>text/css</b> end in the suffix <b>.css</b>, and the
option was renamed from
<b>--html-extension</b>, to better reflect
its new behavior. The old option name is still acceptable,
but should now be considered deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of version
1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files with
a &quot;Content-Encoding&quot; of <b>br</b>,
<b>compress</b>, <b>deflate</b> or <b>gzip</b> end in the
suffix <b>.br</b>, <b>.Z</b>, <b>.zlib</b> and <b>.gz</b>
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At some point
in the future, this option may well be expanded to include
suffixes for other types of content, including content types
that are not parsed by Wget.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--http-user=</b><i>user</i>
<b><br>
--http-password=</b><i>password</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the username
<i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> on an
<small>HTTP</small> server. According to the type of the
challenge, Wget will encode them using either the
&quot;basic&quot; (insecure), the &quot;digest&quot;, or the
Windows &quot;NTLM&quot; authentication scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another way to
specify username and password is in the <small>URL</small>
itself. Either method reveals your password to anyone who
bothers to run &quot;ps&quot;. To prevent the passwords from
being seen, use the <b>--use-askpass</b>
or store them in <i>.wgetrc</i> or <i>.netrc</i>, and make
sure to protect those files from other users with
&quot;chmod&quot;. If the passwords are really important, do
not leave them lying in those files
either---edit the files and delete them
after Wget has started the download.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-http-keep-alive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn off the
&quot;keep-alive&quot; feature for <small>HTTP</small>
downloads. Normally, Wget asks the server to keep the
connection open so that, when you download more than one
document from the same server, they get transferred over the
same <small>TCP</small> connection. This saves time and at
the same time reduces the load on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-alive)
connections don&rsquo;t work for you, for example due to a
server bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to
cope with the connections.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable server-side cache. In
this case, Wget will send the remote server appropriate
directives (<b>Cache-Control: no-cache</b> and <b>Pragma:
no-cache</b>) to get the file from the remote service,
rather than returning the cached version. This is especially
useful for retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on
proxy servers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Caching is
allowed by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-cookies</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable the use of cookies.
Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining server-side state.
The server sends the client a cookie using the
&quot;Set-Cookie&quot; header, and the client responds
with the same cookie upon further requests. Since cookies
allow the server owners to keep track of visitors and for
sites to exchange this information, some consider them a
breach of privacy. The default is to use cookies; however,
<i>storing</i> cookies is not on by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--load-cookies</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Load cookies from <i>file</i>
before the first <small>HTTP</small> retrieval. <i>file</i>
is a textual file in the format originally used by
Netscape&rsquo;s <i>cookies.txt</i> file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You will
typically use this option when mirroring sites that require
that you be logged in to access some or all of their
content. The login process typically works by the web server
issuing an <small>HTTP</small> cookie upon receiving and
verifying your credentials. The cookie is then resent by the
browser when accessing that part of the site, and so proves
your identity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Mirroring such
a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your browser
sends when communicating with the site. This is achieved by
<b>--load-cookies</b>---simply
point Wget to the location of the <i>cookies.txt</i> file,
and it will send the same cookies your browser would send in
the same situation. Different browsers keep textual cookie
files in different locations: <br>
&quot;Netscape 4.x.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The cookies are in
<i>~/.netscape/cookies.txt</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;Mozilla and Netscape
6.x.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Mozilla&rsquo;s cookie file is
also named <i>cookies.txt</i>, located somewhere under
<i>~/.mozilla</i>, in the directory of your profile. The
full path usually ends up looking somewhat like
<i>~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-string/cookies.txt</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;Internet
Explorer.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">You can produce a cookie file
Wget can use by using the File menu, Import and Export,
Export Cookies. This has been tested with Internet Explorer
5; it is not guaranteed to work with earlier versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;Other browsers.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If you are using a different
browser to create your cookies,
<b>--load-cookies</b> will only work if
you can locate or produce a cookie file in the Netscape
format that Wget expects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you cannot
use <b>--load-cookies</b>, there might
still be an alternative. If your browser supports a
&quot;cookie manager&quot;, you can use it to view the
cookies used when accessing the site you&rsquo;re mirroring.
Write down the name and value of the cookie, and manually
instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the
&quot;official&quot; cookie support:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget
--no-cookies --header
&quot;Cookie: &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--save-cookies</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Save cookies to <i>file</i>
before exiting. This will not save cookies that have expired
or that have no expiry time (so-called &quot;session
cookies&quot;), but also see
<b>--keep-session-cookies</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--keep-session-cookies</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When specified, causes
<b>--save-cookies</b> to also save session
cookies. Session cookies are normally not saved because they
are meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit
the browser. Saving them is useful on sites that require you
to log in or to visit the home page before you can access
some pages. With this option, multiple Wget runs are
considered a single browser session as far as the site is
concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since the
cookie file format does not normally carry session cookies,
Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0. Wget&rsquo;s
<b>--load-cookies</b> recognizes those as
session cookies, but it might confuse other browsers. Also
note that cookies so loaded will be treated as other session
cookies, which means that if you want
<b>--save-cookies</b> to preserve them
again, you must use
<b>--keep-session-cookies</b>
again.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ignore-length</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unfortunately, some
<small>HTTP</small> servers ( <small>CGI</small> programs,
to be more precise) send out bogus
&quot;Content-Length&quot; headers, which makes Wget
go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.
You can spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same
document again and again, each time claiming that the
(otherwise normal) connection has closed on the very same
byte.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With this
option, Wget will ignore the
&quot;Content-Length&quot;
header---as if it never existed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--header=</b><i>header-line</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Send <i>header-line</i> along
with the rest of the headers in each <small>HTTP</small>
request. The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it
must contain name and value separated by colon, and must not
contain newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may define
more than one additional header by specifying
<b>--header</b> more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget
--header='Accept-Charset:
iso-8859-2' \ <br>
--header='Accept-Language: hr' \ <br>
http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Specification
of an empty string as the header value will clear all
previous user-defined headers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of Wget
1.10, this option can be used to override headers otherwise
generated automatically. This example instructs Wget to
connect to localhost, but to specify <b>foo.bar</b> in the
&quot;Host&quot; header:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget
--header=&quot;Host: foo.bar&quot;
http://localhost/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In versions of
Wget prior to 1.10 such use of <b>--header</b>
caused sending of duplicate headers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--compression=</b><i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Choose the type of compression
to be used. Legal values are <b>auto</b>, <b>gzip</b> and
<b>none</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>auto</b>
or <b>gzip</b> are specified, Wget asks the server to
compress the file using the gzip compression format. If the
server compresses the file and responds with the
&quot;Content-Encoding&quot; header field set
appropriately, the file will be decompressed
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>none</b>
is specified, wget will not ask the server to compress the
file and will not decompress any server responses. This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Compression
support is currently experimental. In case it is turned on,
please report any bugs to
&quot;bug-wget@gnu.org&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--max-redirect=</b><i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the maximum number of
redirections to follow for a resource. The default is 20,
which is usually far more than necessary. However, on those
occasions where you want to allow more (or fewer), this is
the option to use.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--proxy-user=</b><i>user</i>
<b><br>
--proxy-password=</b><i>password</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the username
<i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> for authentication
on a proxy server. Wget will encode them using the
&quot;basic&quot; authentication scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Security
considerations similar to those with
<b>--http-password</b> pertain here as
well.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--referer=</b><i>url</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Include &lsquo;Referer:
<i>url</i>&rsquo; header in <small>HTTP</small> request.
Useful for retrieving documents with server-side processing
that assume they are always being retrieved by interactive
web browsers and only come out properly when Referer is set
to one of the pages that point to them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--save-headers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Save the headers sent by the
<small>HTTP</small> server to the file, preceding the actual
contents, with an empty line as the separator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-U</b>
<i>agent-string</i> <b><br>
--user-agent=</b><i>agent-string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Identify as <i>agent-string</i>
to the <small>HTTP</small> server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>HTTP</small> protocol allows the clients to identify
themselves using a &quot;User-Agent&quot; header
field. This enables distinguishing the <small>WWW</small>
software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
protocol violations. Wget normally identifies as
<b>Wget/</b><i>version</i>, <i>version</i> being the current
version number of Wget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, some
sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring the
output according to the
&quot;User-Agent&quot;-supplied information.
While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been
abused by servers denying information to clients other than
(historically) Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft
Internet Explorer. This option allows you to change the
&quot;User-Agent&quot; line issued by Wget. Use of
this option is discouraged, unless you really know what you
are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying
empty user agent with
<b>--user-agent=&quot;&quot;</b> instructs
Wget not to send the &quot;User-Agent&quot; header in
<small>HTTP</small> requests.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--post-data=</b><i>string</i>
<b><br>
--post-file=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use <small>POST</small> as the
method for all <small>HTTP</small> requests and send the
specified data in the request body.
<b>--post-data</b> sends <i>string</i> as
data, whereas <b>--post-file</b> sends the
contents of <i>file</i>. Other than that, they work in
exactly the same way. In particular, they <i>both</i> expect
content of the form &quot;key1=value1&amp;key2=value2&quot;,
with percent-encoding for special characters; the only
difference is that one expects its content as a command-line
parameter and the other accepts its content from a file. In
particular, <b>--post-file</b> is
<i>not</i> for transmitting files as form attachments: those
must appear as &quot;key=value&quot; data (with appropriate
percent-coding) just like everything else. Wget does not
currently support &quot;multipart/form-data&quot; for
transmitting <small>POST</small> data; only
&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;.
Only one of <b>--post-data</b> and
<b>--post-file</b> should be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that wget does not require the content to be of the form
&quot;key1=value1&amp;key2=value2&quot;, and neither does it
test for it. Wget will simply transmit whatever data is
provided to it. Most servers however expect the
<small>POST</small> data to be in the above format when
processing <small>HTML</small> Forms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When sending a
<small>POST</small> request using the
<b>--post-file</b> option, Wget treats the
file as a binary file and will send every character in the
<small>POST</small> request without stripping trailing
newline or formfeed characters. Any other control characters
in the text will also be sent as-is in the
<small>POST</small> request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Please be aware
that Wget needs to know the size of the <small>POST</small>
data in advance. Therefore the argument to
&quot;--post-file&quot; must be a regular
file; specifying a <small>FIFO</small> or something like
<i>/dev/stdin</i> won&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s not quite
clear how to work around this limitation inherent in
<small>HTTP/1.0.</small> Although <small>HTTP/1.1</small>
introduces <i>chunked</i> transfer that doesn&rsquo;t
require knowing the request length in advance, a client
can&rsquo;t use chunked unless it knows it&rsquo;s talking
to an <small>HTTP/1.1</small> server. And it can&rsquo;t
know that until it receives a response, which in turn
requires the request to have been completed -- a
chicken-and-egg problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note: As of
version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the
<small>POST</small> request is completed, its behaviour will
depend on the response code returned by the server. In case
of a 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Moved Temporarily or 307
Temporary Redirect, Wget will, in accordance with
<small>RFC2616,</small> continue to send a
<small>POST</small> request. In case a server wants the
client to change the Request method upon redirection, it
should send a 303 See Other response code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This example
shows how to log in to a server using <small>POST</small>
and then proceed to download the desired pages, presumably
only accessible to authorized users:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># Log in to the
server. This can be done only once. <br>
wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \ <br>

-p http://example.com/interesting/article.php</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the server
is using session cookies to track user authentication, the
above will not work because
<b>--save-cookies</b> will not save them
(and neither will browsers) and the <i>cookies.txt</i> file
will be empty. In that case use
<b>--keep-session-cookies</b> along
with <b>--save-cookies</b> to force saving
of session cookies.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--method=</b><i>HTTP-Method</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For the purpose of RESTful
scripting, Wget allows sending of other <small>HTTP</small>
Methods without the need to explicitly set them using
<b>--header=Header-Line</b>. Wget will use
whatever string is passed to it after
<b>--method</b> as the <small>HTTP</small>
Method to the server.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--body-data=</b><i>Data-String</i>
<b><br>
--body-file=</b><i>Data-File</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Must be set when additional
data needs to be sent to the server along with the Method
specified using <b>--method</b>.
<b>--body-data</b> sends <i>string</i> as
data, whereas <b>--body-file</b> sends the
contents of <i>file</i>. Other than that, they work in
exactly the same way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
<b>--body-file</b> is <i>not</i> for
transmitting files as a whole. Wget does not currently
support &quot;multipart/form-data&quot; for
transmitting data; only
&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;.
In the future, this may be changed so that wget sends the
<b>--body-file</b> as a complete file
instead of sending its contents to the server. Please be
aware that Wget needs to know the contents of
<small>BODY</small> Data in advance, and hence the argument
to <b>--body-file</b> should be a regular
file. See <b>--post-file</b> for a more
detailed explanation. Only one of
<b>--body-data</b> and
<b>--body-file</b> should be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If Wget is
redirected after the request is completed, Wget will suspend
the current method and send a <small>GET</small> request
till the redirection is completed. This is true for all
redirection response codes except 307 Temporary Redirect
which is used to explicitly specify that the request method
should <i>not</i> change. Another exception is when the
method is set to &quot;POST&quot;, in which case the
redirection rules specified under
<b>--post-data</b> are followed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--content-disposition</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this is set to on,
experimental (not fully-functional) support for
&quot;Content-Disposition&quot; headers is enabled.
This can currently result in extra round-trips to the server
for a &quot;HEAD&quot; request, and is known to suffer from
a few bugs, which is why it is not currently enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
useful for some file-downloading <small>CGI</small> programs
that use &quot;Content-Disposition&quot; headers to
describe what the name of a downloaded file should be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When combined
with <b>--metalink-over-http</b> and
<b>--trust-server-names</b>, a
<b>Content-Type: application/metalink4+xml</b> file is named
using the &quot;Content-Disposition&quot; filename
field, if available.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--content-on-error</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this is set to on, wget will
not skip the content when the server responds with a http
status code that indicates error.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--trust-server-names</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this is set, on a redirect,
the local file name will be based on the redirection
<small>URL.</small> By default the local file name is based
on the original <small>URL.</small> When doing recursive
retrieving this can be helpful because in many web sites
redirected URLs correspond to an underlying file structure,
while link URLs do not.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--auth-no-challenge</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this option is given, Wget
will send Basic <small>HTTP</small> authentication
information (plaintext username and password) for all
requests, just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use of this
option is not recommended, and is intended only to support
some few obscure servers, which never send
<small>HTTP</small> authentication challenges, but accept
unsolicited auth info, say, in addition to form-based
authentication.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--retry-on-host-error</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider host errors, such as
&quot;Temporary failure in name resolution&quot;, as
non-fatal, transient errors.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--retry-on-http-error=</b><i>code[,code,...]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider given
<small>HTTP</small> response codes as non-fatal, transient
errors. Supply a comma-separated list of 3-digit
<small>HTTP</small> response codes as argument. Useful to
work around special circumstances where retries are
required, but the server responds with an error code
normally not retried by Wget. Such errors might be 503
(Service Unavailable) and 429 (Too Many Requests). Retries
enabled by this option are performed subject to the normal
retry timing and retry count limitations of Wget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
option is intended to support special use cases only and is
generally not recommended, as it can force retries even in
cases where the server is actually trying to decrease its
load. Please use wisely and only if you know what you are
doing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>HTTPS</small>
( <small>SSL/TLS</small> ) Options</b> <br>
To support encrypted <small>HTTP</small> (
<small>HTTPS</small> ) downloads, Wget must be compiled with
an external <small>SSL</small> library. The current default
is GnuTLS. In addition, Wget also supports
<small>HSTS</small> ( <small>HTTP</small> Strict Transport
Security). If Wget is compiled without <small>SSL</small>
support, none of these options are available. <b><br>
--secure-protocol=</b><i>protocol</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Choose the secure protocol to
be used. Legal values are <b>auto</b>, <b>SSLv2</b>,
<b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1_1</b>, <b>TLSv1_2</b>,
<b>TLSv1_3</b> and <b><small>PFS</small></b> . If
<b>auto</b> is used, the <small>SSL</small> library is given
the liberty of choosing the appropriate protocol
automatically, which is achieved by sending a TLSv1
greeting. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying
<b>SSLv2</b>, <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1_1</b>,
<b>TLSv1_2</b> or <b>TLSv1_3</b> forces the use of the
corresponding protocol. This is useful when talking to old
and buggy <small>SSL</small> server implementations that
make it hard for the underlying <small>SSL</small> library
to choose the correct protocol version. Fortunately, such
servers are quite rare.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying
<b><small>PFS</small></b> enforces the use of the so-called
Perfect Forward Security cipher suites. In short,
<small>PFS</small> adds security by creating a one-time key
for each <small>SSL</small> connection. It has a bit more
<small>CPU</small> impact on client and server. We use known
to be secure ciphers (e.g. no <small>MD4</small> ) and the
<small>TLS</small> protocol. This mode also explicitly
excludes non-PFS key exchange methods, such as
<small>RSA.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--https-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When in recursive mode, only
<small>HTTPS</small> links are followed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ciphers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the cipher list string.
Typically this string sets the cipher suites and other
<small>SSL/TLS</small> options that the user wish should be
used, in a set order of preference (GnuTLS calls it
&rsquo;priority string&rsquo;). This string will be fed
verbatim to the <small>SSL/TLS</small> engine (OpenSSL or
GnuTLS) and hence its format and syntax is dependent on
that. Wget will not process or manipulate it in any way.
Refer to the OpenSSL or GnuTLS documentation for more
information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-check-certificate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t check the server
certificate against the available certificate authorities.
Also don&rsquo;t require the <small>URL</small> host name to
match the common name presented by the certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of Wget
1.10, the default is to verify the server&rsquo;s
certificate against the recognized certificate authorities,
breaking the <small>SSL</small> handshake and aborting the
download if the verification fails. Although this provides
more secure downloads, it does break interoperability with
some sites that worked with previous Wget versions,
particularly those using self-signed, expired, or otherwise
invalid certificates. This option forces an
&quot;insecure&quot; mode of operation that turns the
certificate verification errors into warnings and allows you
to proceed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you
encounter &quot;certificate verification&quot; errors or
ones saying that &quot;common name doesn&rsquo;t match
requested host name&quot;, you can use this option to bypass
the verification and proceed with the download. <i>Only use
this option if you are otherwise convinced of the
site&rsquo;s authenticity, or if you really don&rsquo;t care
about the validity of its certificate.</i> It is almost
always a bad idea not to check the certificates when
transmitting confidential or important data. For
self-signed/internal certificates, you should download
the certificate and verify against that instead of forcing
this insecure mode. If you are really sure of not desiring
any certificate verification, you can specify
--check-certificate=quiet to tell wget to
not print any warning about invalid certificates, albeit in
most cases this is the wrong thing to do.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--certificate=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the client certificate
stored in <i>file</i>. This is needed for servers that are
configured to require certificates from the clients that
connect to them. Normally a certificate is not required and
this switch is optional.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--certificate-type=</b><i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the type of the client
certificate. Legal values are <b><small>PEM</small></b>
(assumed by default) and <b><small>DER</small></b> , also
known as <b><small>ASN1</small></b> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--private-key=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Read the private key from
<i>file</i>. This allows you to provide the private key in a
file separate from the certificate.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--private-key-type=</b><i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the type of the private
key. Accepted values are <b><small>PEM</small></b> (the
default) and <b><small>DER</small></b> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ca-certificate=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use <i>file</i> as the file
with the bundle of certificate authorities (&quot;
<small>CA&quot;</small> ) to verify the peers. The
certificates must be in <small>PEM</small> format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option Wget looks for <small>CA</small> certificates at the
system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation
time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ca-directory=</b><i>directory</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies directory containing
<small>CA</small> certificates in <small>PEM</small> format.
Each file contains one <small>CA</small> certificate, and
the file name is based on a hash value derived from the
certificate. This is achieved by processing a certificate
directory with the &quot;c_rehash&quot; utility supplied
with OpenSSL. Using <b>--ca-directory</b>
is more efficient than
<b>--ca-certificate</b> when many
certificates are installed because it allows Wget to fetch
certificates on demand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option Wget looks for <small>CA</small> certificates at the
system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation
time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--crl-file=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies a <small>CRL</small>
file in <i>file</i>. This is needed for certificates that
have been revocated by the CAs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--pinnedpubkey=file/hashes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Tells wget to use the specified
public key file (or hashes) to verify the peer. This can be
a path to a file which contains a single public key in
<small>PEM</small> or <small>DER</small> format, or any
number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by
&quot;sha256//&quot; and separated by &quot;;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
negotiating a <small>TLS</small> or <small>SSL</small>
connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its
identity. A public key is extracted from this certificate
and if it does not exactly match the public key(s) provided
to this option, wget will abort the connection before
sending or receiving any data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--random-file=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">[OpenSSL and LibreSSL only] Use
<i>file</i> as the source of random data for seeding the
pseudo-random number generator on systems without
<i>/dev/urandom</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On such systems
the <small>SSL</small> library needs an external source of
randomness to initialize. Randomness may be provided by
<small>EGD</small> (see <b>--egd-file</b>
below) or read from an external source specified by the
user. If this option is not specified, Wget looks for random
data in $RANDFILE or, if that is unset, in
<i>$HOME/.rnd</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
getting the &quot;Could not seed OpenSSL <small>PRNG</small>
; disabling <small>SSL.&quot;</small> error, you should
provide random data using some of the methods described
above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--egd-file=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">[OpenSSL only] Use <i>file</i>

for <i>Entropy Gathering Daemon</i>, a user-space program
that collects data from various unpredictable system sources

Encryption software, such as the <small>SSL</small> library,
needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed the random
number generator used to produce cryptographically strong
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">OpenSSL allows
the user to specify his own source of entropy using the
&quot;RAND_FILE&quot; environment variable. If this variable
is unset, or if the specified file does not produce enough

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this option
is not specified (and the equivalent startup command is not
used), <small>EGD</small> is never contacted.
<small>EGD</small> is not needed on modern Unix systems that
support <i>/dev/urandom</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-hsts</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Wget supports
<small>HSTS</small> ( <small>HTTP</small> Strict Transport
Security, <small>RFC 6797</small> ) by default. Use
<b>--no-hsts</b> to make Wget act as a
non-HSTS-compliant <small>UA.</small> As a consequence, Wget
would ignore all the
&quot;Strict-Transport-Security&quot; headers,
and would not enforce any existing <small>HSTS</small>
policy.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--hsts-file=</b><i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, Wget stores its
<small>HSTS</small> database in <i>~/.wget-hsts</i>.
You can use <b>--hsts-file</b> to override
this. Wget will use the supplied file as the
<small>HSTS</small> database. Such file must conform to the
correct <small>HSTS</small> database format used by Wget. If
Wget cannot parse the provided file, the behaviour is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
Wget&rsquo;s <small>HSTS</small> database is a plain text
file. Each line contains an <small>HSTS</small> entry (ie. a
site that has issued a
&quot;Strict-Transport-Security&quot; header and
that therefore has specified a concrete <small>HSTS</small>
policy to be applied). Lines starting with a dash
(&quot;#&quot;) are ignored by Wget. Please note that in
spite of this convenient human-readability hand-hacking the
<small>HSTS</small> database is generally not a good
idea.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">An
<small>HSTS</small> entry line consists of several fields
separated by one or more whitespace:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;&lt;hostname&gt;
SP [&lt;port&gt;] SP &lt;include subdomains&gt; SP
&lt;created&gt; SP &lt;max-age&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>hostname</i> and <i>port</i> fields indicate the hostname
and port to which the given <small>HSTS</small> policy
applies. The <i>port</i> field may be zero, and it will, in
most of the cases. That means that the port number will not
be taken into account when deciding whether such
<small>HSTS</small> policy should be applied on a given
request (only the hostname will be evaluated). When
<i>port</i> is different to zero, both the target hostname
and the port will be evaluated and the <small>HSTS</small>
policy will only be applied if both of them match. This
feature has been included for testing/development purposes
only. The Wget testsuite (in <i>testenv/</i>) creates
<small>HSTS</small> databases with explicit ports with the
purpose of ensuring Wget&rsquo;s correct behaviour. Applying
<small>HSTS</small> policies to ports other than the default
ones is discouraged by <small>RFC 6797</small> (see Appendix
B &quot;Differences between <small>HSTS</small> Policy and
Same-Origin Policy&quot;). Thus, this functionality should
not be used in production environments and <i>port</i> will
typically be zero. The last three fields do what they are
expected to. The field <i>include_subdomains</i> can either
be 1 or 0 and it signals whether the subdomains of the
target domain should be part of the given
<small>HSTS</small> policy as well. The <i>created</i> and
<i>max-age</i> fields hold the timestamp values of when such
entry was created (first seen by Wget) and the HSTS-defined
value &rsquo;max-age&rsquo;, which states how long
should that <small>HSTS</small> policy remain active,
measured in seconds elapsed since the timestamp stored in
<i>created</i>. Once that time has passed, that
<small>HSTS</small> policy will no longer be valid and will
eventually be removed from the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you supply
your own <small>HSTS</small> database via
<b>--hsts-file</b>, be aware that Wget may
modify the provided file if any change occurs between the
<small>HSTS</small> policies requested by the remote servers
and those in the file. When Wget exits, it effectively
updates the <small>HSTS</small> database by rewriting the
database file with the new entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the supplied
file does not exist, Wget will create one. This file will
contain the new <small>HSTS</small> entries. If no
<small>HSTS</small> entries were generated (no
&quot;Strict-Transport-Security&quot; headers
were sent by any of the servers) then no file will be
created, not even an empty one. This behaviour applies to
the default database file (<i>~/.wget-hsts</i>) as
well: it will not be created until some server enforces an
<small>HSTS</small> policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Care is taken
not to override possible changes made by other Wget
processes at the same time over the <small>HSTS</small>
database. Before dumping the updated <small>HSTS</small>
entries on the file, Wget will re-read it and merge the
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using a custom
<small>HSTS</small> database and/or modifying an existing
one is discouraged. For more information about the potential
security threats arose from such practice, see section 14

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>FTP</small>
Options <br>
--ftp-user=</b><i>user</i> <b><br>
--ftp-password=</b><i>password</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the username
<i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> on an
<small>FTP</small> server. Without this, or the
corresponding startup option, the password defaults to
<b>-wget@</b>, normally used for anonymous
<small>FTP.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another way to
specify username and password is in the <small>URL</small>
itself. Either method reveals your password to anyone who
bothers to run &quot;ps&quot;. To prevent the passwords from
being seen, store them in <i>.wgetrc</i> or <i>.netrc</i>,
and make sure to protect those files from other users with
&quot;chmod&quot;. If the passwords are really important, do
not leave them lying in those files
either---edit the files and delete them
after Wget has started the download.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-remove-listing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t remove the
temporary <i>.listing</i> files generated by
<small>FTP</small> retrievals. Normally, these files contain
the raw directory listings received from <small>FTP</small>
servers. Not removing them can be useful for debugging
purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on the
contents of remote server directories (e.g. to verify that a
mirror you&rsquo;re running is complete).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that even
though Wget writes to a known filename for this file, this
is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
<i>.listing</i> a symbolic link to <i>/etc/passwd</i> or
something and asking &quot;root&quot; to run Wget in his or
her directory. Depending on the options used, either Wget
will refuse to write to <i>.listing</i>, making the
globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or
the symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the
actual <i>.listing</i> file, or the listing will be written
to a <i>.listing.number</i> file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Even though
this situation isn&rsquo;t a problem, though,
&quot;root&quot; should never run Wget in a non-trusted
user&rsquo;s directory. A user could do something as simple
as linking <i>index.html</i> to <i>/etc/passwd</i> and
asking &quot;root&quot; to run Wget with <b>-N</b> or
<b>-r</b> so the file will be overwritten.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-glob</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn off <small>FTP</small>
globbing. Globbing refers to the use of shell-like special
characters (<i>wildcards</i>), like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>,
<b>[</b> and <b>]</b> to retrieve more than one file from
the same directory at once, like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget
ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
globbing will be turned on if the <small>URL</small>
contains a globbing character. This option may be used to
turn globbing on or off permanently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may have to
quote the <small>URL</small> to protect it from being
expanded by your shell. Globbing makes Wget look for a
directory listing, which is system-specific. This is why it
currently works only with Unix <small>FTP</small> servers
(and the ones emulating Unix &quot;ls&quot; output).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-passive-ftp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable the use of the
<i>passive</i> <small>FTP</small> transfer mode. Passive
<small>FTP</small> mandates that the client connect to the
server to establish the data connection rather than the
other way around.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the machine
is connected to the Internet directly, both passive and
active <small>FTP</small> should work equally well. Behind
most firewall and <small>NAT</small> configurations passive
<small>FTP</small> has a better chance of working. However,
in some rare firewall configurations, active
<small>FTP</small> actually works when passive
<small>FTP</small> doesn&rsquo;t. If you suspect this to be
the case, use this option, or set
&quot;passive_ftp=off&quot; in your init file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--preserve-permissions</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Preserve remote file
permissions instead of permissions set by umask.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--retr-symlinks</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, when retrieving
<small>FTP</small> directories recursively and a symbolic
link is encountered, the symbolic link is traversed and the
pointed-to files are retrieved. Currently, Wget does not
traverse symbolic links to directories to download them
recursively, though this feature may be added in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>--retr-symlinks=no</b> is specified,
the linked-to file is not downloaded. Instead, a matching
symbolic link is created on the local filesystem. The
pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless this recursive
retrieval would have encountered it separately and
downloaded it anyway. This option poses a security risk
where a malicious <small>FTP</small> Server may cause Wget
to write to files outside of the intended directories
through a specially crafted .LISTING file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was specified
on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed to,
this option has no effect. Symbolic links are always
traversed in this case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>FTPS</small>
Options <br>
--ftps-implicit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option tells Wget to use
<small>FTPS</small> implicitly. Implicit <small>FTPS</small>
consists of initializing <small>SSL/TLS</small> from the
very beginning of the control connection. This option does
not send an &quot;AUTH TLS&quot; command: it assumes the
server speaks <small>FTPS</small> and directly starts an
<small>SSL/TLS</small> connection. If the attempt is
successful, the session continues just like regular
<small>FTPS</small> (&quot;PBSZ&quot; and &quot;PROT&quot;
are sent, etc.). Implicit <small>FTPS</small> is no longer a
requirement for <small>FTPS</small> implementations, and
thus many servers may not support it. If
<b>--ftps-implicit</b> is passed and no
explicit port number specified, the default port for
implicit <small>FTPS, 990,</small> will be used, instead of
the default port for the &quot;normal&quot; (explicit)
<small>FTPS</small> which is the same as that of <small>FTP,
21.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-ftps-resume-ssl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not resume the
<small>SSL/TLS</small> session in the data channel. When
starting a data connection, Wget tries to resume the
<small>SSL/TLS</small> session previously started in the
control connection. <small>SSL/TLS</small> session
resumption avoids performing an entirely new handshake by
reusing the <small>SSL/TLS</small> parameters of a previous
session. Typically, the <small>FTPS</small> servers want it
that way, so Wget does this by default. Under rare
circumstances however, one might want to start an entirely
new <small>SSL/TLS</small> session in every data connection.
This is what
<b>--no-ftps-resume-ssl</b> is
for.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ftps-clear-data-connection</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All the data connections will
be in plain text. Only the control connection will be under
<small>SSL/TLS.</small> Wget will send a &quot;PROT C&quot;
command to achieve this, which must be approved by the
server.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ftps-fallback-to-ftp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Fall back to <small>FTP</small>
if <small>FTPS</small> is not supported by the target
server. For security reasons, this option is not asserted by
default. The default behaviour is to exit with an error. If
a server does not successfully reply to the initial
&quot;AUTH TLS&quot; command, or in the case of implicit
<small>FTPS,</small> if the initial <small>SSL/TLS</small>
connection attempt is rejected, it is considered that such
server does not support <small>FTPS.</small></p>

The default maximum depth is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l</b> <i>depth</i>
<b><br>
--level=</b><i>depth</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the maximum number of
subdirectories that Wget will recurse into to <i>depth</i>.
In order to prevent one from accidentally downloading very
large websites when using recursion this is limited to a
depth of 5 by default, i.e., it will traverse at most 5
directories deep starting from the provided
<small>URL.</small> Set <b>-l 0</b> or <b>-l
inf</b> for infinite recursion depth.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -r
-l 0 http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Ideally, one
would expect this to download just <i>1.html</i>. but
unfortunately this is not the case, because <b>-l
0</b> is equivalent to <b>-l
inf</b>---that is, infinite recursion. To
download a single <small>HTML</small> page (or a handful of
them), specify them all on the command line and leave away
<b>-r</b> and <b>-l</b>. To download the
essential items to view a single <small>HTML</small> page,
see <b>page requisites</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--delete-after</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option tells Wget to
delete every single file it downloads, <i>after</i> having
done so. It is useful for pre-fetching popular pages through
a proxy, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -r
-nd --delete-after
http://whatever.com/~popular/page/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-r</b> option is to retrieve recursively, and
<b>-nd</b> to not create directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>--delete-after</b> deletes files on the
local machine. It does not issue the
<b><small>DELE</small></b> command to remote
<small>FTP</small> sites, for instance. Also note that when
<b>--delete-after</b> is specified,
<b>--convert-links</b> is ignored, so
<b>.orig</b> files are simply not created in the first
place.</p>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--convert-links</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">After the download is complete,
convert the links in the document to make them suitable for
local viewing. This affects not only the visible hyperlinks,
but any part of the document that links to external content,
such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks
to non-HTML content, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Each link will
be changed in one of the two ways:</p>

relative link.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Example: if the
downloaded file <i>/foo/doc.html</i> links to
<i>/bar/img.gif</i>, also downloaded, then the link in
<i>doc.html</i> will be modified to point to
<b>../bar/img.gif</b>. This kind of transformation works
reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The links to files that have not
been downloaded by Wget will be changed to include host name
and absolute path of the location they point to.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Example: if the
downloaded file <i>/foo/doc.html</i> links to
<i>/bar/img.gif</i> (or to <i>../bar/img.gif</i>), then the
link in <i>doc.html</i> will be modified to point to
<i>http://hostname/bar/img.gif</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because of
this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was
downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was
not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet
address rather than presenting a broken link. The fact that
the former links are converted to relative links ensures
that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to another
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that only
at the end of the download can Wget know which links have
been downloaded. Because of that, the work done by
<b>-k</b> will be performed at the end of all the
downloads.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--convert-file-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option converts only the
filename part of the URLs, leaving the rest of the URLs
untouched. This filename part is sometimes referred to as
the &quot;basename&quot;, although we avoid that term here
in order not to cause confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It works
particularly well in conjunction with
<b>--adjust-extension</b>, although this
coupling is not enforced. It proves useful to populate
Internet caches with files downloaded from different
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example: if
some link points to <i>//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz</i> with
<b>--adjust-extension</b> asserted and its
local destination is intended to be
<i>./foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css</i>, then the link would be
converted to <i>//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css</i>. Note that
only the filename part has been modified. The rest of the
<small>URL</small> has been left untouched, including the
net path (&quot;//&quot;) which would otherwise be processed
by Wget and converted to the effective scheme (ie.
&quot;http://&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--mirror</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn on options suitable for
mirroring. This option turns on recursion and time-stamping,
sets infinite recursion depth and keeps <small>FTP</small>
directory listings. It is currently equivalent to
<b>-r -N -l inf
--no-remove-listing</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--page-requisites</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option causes Wget to
download all the files that are necessary to properly
display a given <small>HTML</small> page. This includes such
things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced
stylesheets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily,
when downloading a single <small>HTML</small> page, any
requisite documents that may be needed to display it
properly are not downloaded. Using <b>-r</b> together
with <b>-l</b> can help, but since Wget does not
ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined
documents, one is generally left with &quot;leaf
documents&quot; that are missing their requisites.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For instance,
say document <i>1.html</i> contains an
&quot;&lt;IMG&gt;&quot; tag referencing <i>1.gif</i> and an
&quot;&lt;A&gt;&quot; tag pointing to external document
<i>2.html</i>. Say that <i>2.html</i> is similar but that
its image is <i>2.gif</i> and it links to <i>3.html</i>. Say
this continues up to some arbitrarily high number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If one executes
the command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -r
-l 2 http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">then
<i>1.html</i>, <i>1.gif</i>, <i>2.html</i>, <i>2.gif</i>,
and <i>3.html</i> will be downloaded. As you can see,
<i>3.html</i> is without its requisite <i>3.gif</i> because
Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up to 2) away
from <i>1.html</i> in order to determine where to stop the
recursion. However, with this command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -r
-l 2 -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">all the above
files <i>and 3.html</i>&rsquo;s requisite <i>3.gif</i> will
be downloaded. Similarly,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -r
-l 1 -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">will cause
<i>1.html</i>, <i>1.gif</i>, <i>2.html</i>, and <i>2.gif</i>
to be downloaded. One might think that:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -r
-l 0 -p http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">would download
just <i>1.html</i> and <i>1.gif</i>, but unfortunately this
is not the case, because <b>-l 0</b> is equivalent to
<b>-l inf</b>---that is, infinite
recursion. To download a single <small>HTML</small> page (or
a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a
<b>-i</b> <small>URL</small> input file) and its (or
their) requisites, simply leave off <b>-r</b> and
<b>-l</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that Wget
will behave as if <b>-r</b> had been specified, but
only that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.
Links from that page to external documents will not be
followed. Actually, to download a single page and all its
requisites (even if they exist on separate websites), and
make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author
likes to use a few options in addition to
<b>-p</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget -E
-H -k -K -p
http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To finish off
this topic, it&rsquo;s worth knowing that Wget&rsquo;s idea
of an external document link is any <small>URL</small>
specified in an &quot;&lt;A&gt;&quot; tag, an
&quot;&lt;AREA&gt;&quot; tag, or a &quot;&lt;LINK&gt;&quot;
tag other than &quot;&lt;LINK
REL=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--strict-comments</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn on strict parsing of
<small>HTML</small> comments. The default is to terminate
comments at the first occurrence of
<b>--&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">According to
specifications, <small>HTML</small> comments are expressed
as <small>SGML</small> <i>declarations</i>. Declaration is
special markup that begins with <b>&lt;!</b> and ends with
<b>&gt;</b>, such as <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;</b>, that may
contain comments between a pair of <b>--</b>
delimiters. <small>HTML</small> comments are &quot;empty
declarations&quot;, <small>SGML</small> declarations without
any non-comment text. Therefore,
<b>&lt;!--foo--&gt;</b> is a valid
comment, and so is <b>&lt;!--one--
--two--&gt;</b>, but
<b>&lt;!--1--2--&gt;</b>
is not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, most <small>HTML</small> writers don&rsquo;t perceive
comments as anything other than text delimited with
<b>&lt;!--</b> and <b>--&gt;</b>,
which is not quite the same. For example, something like
<b>&lt;!------------&gt;</b>
works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is
a multiple of four (!). If not, the comment technically
lasts until the next <b>--</b>, which may be at
the other end of the document. Because of this, many popular
browsers completely ignore the specification and implement
what users have come to expect: comments delimited with
<b>&lt;!--</b> and
<b>--&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Until version
1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in
missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in
browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant
comments. Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has joined the
ranks of clients that implements &quot;naive&quot; comments,
terminating each comment at the first occurrence of
<b>--&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If, for
whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
option to turn it on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Recursive
Accept/Reject Options <br>
-A</b> <i>acclist</i> <b>--accept</b>
<i>acclist</i> <b><br>
-R</b> <i>rejlist</i> <b>--reject</b>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify comma-separated lists
of file name suffixes or patterns to accept or reject. Note
that if any of the wildcard characters, <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>,
<b>[</b> or <b>]</b>, appear in an element of <i>acclist</i>
or <i>rejlist</i>, it will be treated as a pattern, rather
than a suffix. In this case, you have to enclose the pattern
into quotes to prevent your shell from expanding it, like in
<b>-A &quot;*.mp3&quot;</b> or <b>-A
&rsquo;*.mp3&rsquo;</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--accept-regex</b>
<i>urlregex</i> <b><br>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify a regular expression to
accept or reject the complete <small>URL.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--regex-type</b>
<i>regextype</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the regular expression
type. Possible types are <b>posix</b> or <b>pcre</b>. Note
that to be able to use <b>pcre</b> type, wget has to be
compiled with libpcre support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-D</b>
<i>domain-list</i> <b><br>
--domains=</b><i>domain-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set domains to be followed.
<i>domain-list</i> is a comma-separated list of domains.
Note that it does <i>not</i> turn on <b>-H</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--exclude-domains</b>
<i>domain-list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the domains that are
<i>not</i> to be followed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--follow-ftp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Follow <small>FTP</small> links
from <small>HTML</small> documents. Without this option,
Wget will ignore all the <small>FTP</small> links.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--follow-tags=</b><i>list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Wget has an internal table of
<small>HTML</small> tag / attribute pairs that it considers
when looking for linked documents during a recursive
retrieval. If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags
in a comma-separated <i>list</i> with this option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ignore-tags=</b><i>list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the opposite of the
<b>--follow-tags</b> option. To skip
certain <small>HTML</small> tags when recursively looking
for documents to download, specify them in a comma-separated
<i>list</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the past,
this option was the best bet for downloading a single page
and its requisites, using a command-line like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">wget
--ignore-tags=a,area -H -k
-K -r http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
author of this option came across a page with tags like
&quot;&lt;LINK REL=&quot;home&quot;
HREF=&quot;/&quot;&gt;&quot; and came to the realization
that specifying tags to ignore was not enough. One
can&rsquo;t just tell Wget to ignore
&quot;&lt;LINK&gt;&quot;, because then stylesheets will not
be downloaded. Now the best bet for downloading a single
page and its requisites is the dedicated
<b>--page-requisites</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ignore-case</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore case when matching files
and directories. This influences the behavior of -R,
-A, -I, and -X options, as well as
globbing implemented when downloading from
<small>FTP</small> sites. For example, with this option,
<b>-A &quot;*.txt&quot;</b> will match
<b>file1.txt</b>, but also <b>file2.TXT</b>,
<b>file3.TxT</b>, and so on. The quotes in the example are
to prevent the shell from expanding the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wget supports

https_proxy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If set, the <b>http_proxy</b>
and <b>https_proxy</b> variables should contain the URLs of

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ftp_proxy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This variable should contain

exceptions of 0 and 1, the lower-numbered exit codes take
precedence over higher-numbered ones, when multiple types of
errors are encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In versions of
Wget prior to 1.12, Wget&rsquo;s exit status tended to be
unhelpful and inconsistent. Recursive downloads would
virtually always return 0 (success), regardless of any
issues encountered, and non-recursive fetches only returned
the status corresponding to the most recently-attempted
download.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are welcome
to submit bug reports via the <small>GNU</small> Wget bug
tracker (see
&lt;<b>https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=additem&amp;group=wget</b>&gt;)
or to our mailing list
&lt;<b>bug-wget@gnu.org</b>&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Visit
&lt;<b>https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget</b>&gt;
to get more info (how to subscribe, list archives, ...).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before actually
submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few simple
guidelines.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really
is a bug. If Wget crashes, it&rsquo;s a bug. If Wget does
not behave as documented, it&rsquo;s a bug. If things work
strange, but you are not sure about the way they are
supposed to work, it might well be a bug, but you might want
to double-check the documentation and the mailing lists.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as
possible. E.g. if Wget crashes while downloading <b>wget
-rl0 -kKE -t5 --no-proxy
http://example.com -o /tmp/log</b>, you should try to
see if the crash is repeatable, and if will occur with a
simpler set of options. You might even try to start the
download at the page where the crash occurred to see if that
page somehow triggered the crash.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also, while I
will probably be interested to know the contents of your
<i>.wgetrc</i> file, just dumping it into the debug message
is probably a bad idea. Instead, you should first try to see
if the bug repeats with <i>.wgetrc</i> moved out of the way.
Only if it turns out that <i>.wgetrc</i> settings affect the
bug, mail me the relevant parts of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please start Wget with
<b>-d</b> option and send us the resulting output (or
relevant parts thereof). If Wget was compiled without debug
support, recompile it---it is <i>much</i>
easier to trace bugs with debug support on.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note: please
make sure to remove any potentially sensitive information
from the debug log before sending it to the bug address. The
&quot;-d&quot; won&rsquo;t go out of its way to
collect sensitive information, but the log <i>will</i>
contain a fairly complete transcript of Wget&rsquo;s
communication with the server, which may include passwords
and pieces of downloaded data. Since the bug address is
publicly archived, you may assume that all bug reports are
visible to the public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Wget has crashed, try to run
it in a debugger, e.g. &quot;gdb `which wget` core&quot; and
type &quot;where&quot; to get the backtrace. This may not
work if the system administrator has disabled core files,
but it is safe to try.</p></td></tr>
