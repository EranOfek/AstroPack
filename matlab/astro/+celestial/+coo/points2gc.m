function [Lon1, Lat1, Az] = points2gc(Lon1, Lat1, Lon2, Lat2, Units)
    % Convert two points on a sphere to great circle representation (Lon, Lat, Az)
    % Input  : - Array of longitudes of first point.
    %          - Array of latitudes of first point.
    %          - Array of longitudes of second point.
    %          - Array of latitudes of second point.
    %          - Units for input and output: ['rad'] | 'deg'.
    % Output : - Array of longitudes of first point.
    %          - Array of latitudes of first point.
    %          - Array of position angles (azimuth) between the two points.
    %            Azimuth is the angle a line makes with a meridian, measured clockwise from north.
    %            Thus the azimuth of due north is 0째,
    %            due east is 90째, due south is 180째, and due west is 270째.
