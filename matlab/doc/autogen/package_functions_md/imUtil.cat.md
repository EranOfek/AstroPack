### imUtil.cat.affine2d_transformation

Applay a 2D affine transformation to [X,Y] coordinates Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Applay a 2D affine transformation to [X,Y] coordinates


### imUtil.cat.astrometric_cat

Get astrometric catalog, corrected for proper motion Package: +imUtil.cat


### imUtil.cat.dilute_cat_by_mag

Remove faint sources from a catalog to have a specific surface density Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Dilute sources from a acatalog based on sources magnitude. Remove the faintest sources and sources which have NaN


### imUtil.cat.flag_overdense

Flag sources that are found in overdense (box shaped) regions Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Given a catalog of [X,Y] positions, flag sources that are found in regions which their density is above a threshold.


### imUtil.cat.flag_overdense_colrow

Flag sources that are found in overdense (box shaped) regions Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Given a catalog of [X,Y] positions, flag sources that are found in regions which their density is above a threshold.


### imUtil.cat.match_sources

Match sources in two catalogs with the same coordinates systems. Package: imUtil.cat Description: Match a catalog and reference catalog which are on the same 2-D coordinate system.


### imUtil.cat.match_sources_xy

Match sources between Cat and Ref catalogs using their X/Y (planar) coordinates. Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Matched the sources in Cat to sources in Ref by planar X/Y coordinates.


### imUtil.cat.surface_density

Estimate surface density in catalog, optionally using convex hull Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Estimate the surface density and area that a catalog is covering. The area is estimated using either the box size,
