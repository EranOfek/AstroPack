Class: imProc.image.obsolete.Dark

Dark - Constructor for a Dark object

bias - Generate a super bias image from a s et of bias images.

compare2template - Compare AstroImage to a template and variance and flag image which are different than the template.

debias - Subtract bias (and construct if needed) from a list of images

identifyFlaringPixels - Identify flaring pixels in a cube of images Searched by looking at (Cube-Mean)/Std>Threshold

identifySimilarImages - Search for sucessive images with a fraction of identical pixel values This is useful in order to identify problems with the detector firmware (i.e., some regions of the detector in two surcessive images are identical due to a readout

isBias - Check and validate that a set of images in an AstroImage object are bias images

isDark - Check and validate that a set of images in an AstroImage object are dark images

overscan - Create overscan images and optionally subtract from images

unitTest - unitTest for the Dark class Example: Result = imProc.image.Dark.unitTest
