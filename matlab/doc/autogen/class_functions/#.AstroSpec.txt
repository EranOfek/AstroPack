Class: AstroSpec

AstroSpec - constructor for AstroSpec

applyAtmosphericExt - Apply atmospheric extinction (airmass) to AstroSpec object. One to one, or one to many.

applyExtinctionZ - Calculate extinction to observed wavelngth vector in various redshifts.

atmosphericExtinction - Return Atmospheric extinction The extinction im mag/transmission is provided in the Flux field.

blackBody - Create an AstroSpec object with black body spectra Return specific (per Ang) luminosity or emittence.

filterFun - Apply a 1-D function (filter) on the Flux field in AstroSpec object. The function do not check if the wavelength is equally spaced. The function operates on the Flux, FluxErr, and Back fields.

fitMag - Fit AstroSpec spectra to observed magnitudes in some bands.

fitSpec - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

funBinary - Perform a binary operation on two AstroSpec objects The operation is applied one to one or one to many.

funFlux - Apply a function to the Flux, FluxErr, Back columns.

get.Back - getter for Back

get.Cont - getter for Cont

get.Flux - getter for Flux

get.FluxErr - getter for FluxErr

get.FluxUnits - getter for FluxUnits

get.Mask - getter for Mask data

get.Wave - getter for Wave

get.WaveUnits - getter for WaveUnits

interp1 - Interpolate the elements of AstroSpec into a new wavelength grid. The Mask will be interpolated using nearest interpolation. This function works only if the Data is convertable to a numeric matrix.

interpAndKeepOverlap - Given two AstroSpec objects, interpolate the first into the wavelength grid defined by the second and keep only the overlaping points.

interpLogSpace - Interpolate an AstroSpec object into a logarithmic wavelength grid.

interpOverNan - Interpolate AstroSpec object over NaNs.

interpOverRanges - Interpolate AstroSpec object over some ranges Useful for interpolation over ranges containing spectral lines.

length - Return length of each spectrum in AstroSpec object

plot - Plot all the spectra in an AstroSpec object

read2FilterMatrix - Convet a filter name/AstFilter to cell of transmissions

redshift - Apply redshift to a spectrum Divide wave by (1+z) and multiply flux by (1+z) Correct also FluxErr and Back

scaleFlux - Scale (multiply) flux properties by some factor.

scaleSynphot - Scale spectrum such that its synthetic magnitude will be forced to some value.

selectWave - Select lines from AstroSpec (don't generate a new copy)

set.Back - setter for Back

set.Cont - setter for Cont

set.Flux - setter for Flux

set.FluxErr - setter for FluxErr

set.FluxUnits - setter for FluxUnits

set.Mask - setter for Mask data

set.Wave - setter for Wave

set.WaveUnits - setter for WaveUnits

sort - Sort elements of AstroSpec object by wavelength

specCALSPEC - Get STSCI CALSPEC template spectrum from ../spec/CALSPEC/ data directory.

specGalQSO - Get galaxy/qso template spectrum from ../spec/SpecGalQSO/ data directory. Description: Get Galaxy or QSO spectral template from local database.

specStarsPickles - Load Pickles stellar spectra into an AstroSpec object

synphot - Synthetic photometry on an AstroSpec object spectra

synspecGAIA - Load GAIA synthetic spectra and if necessey interpolate over Temperature (other parameters are not interpolated).

unitTest - unitTest for AstroSpec
