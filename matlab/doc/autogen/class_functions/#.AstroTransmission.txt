Class: AstroTransmission

AstroTransmission - constructor for AstroTransmission Populate an AstroTransmission object.

atmosphericExtinction - Return Atmospheric extinction The extinction im mag/transmission is provided in the Flux field.

filterFun - Apply a 1-D function (filter) on the Flux field in AstroSpec object. The function do not check if the wavelength is equally spaced. The function operates on the Flux, FluxErr, and Back fields.

genNames - Generate names for filters

genTopHat - Generate a series of top-hat filters (Type='filter').

get - 

getFilt - 

interp1 - Interpolate the elements of AstroSpec into a new wavelength grid. The Mask will be interpolated using nearest interpolation. This function works only if the Data is convertable to a numeric matrix.

interpAndKeepOverlap - Given two AstroSpec objects, interpolate the first into the wavelength grid defined by the second and keep only the overlaping points.

interpLogSpace - Interpolate an AstroSpec object into a logarithmic wavelength grid.

interpOverNan - Interpolate AstroSpec object over NaNs.

interpOverRanges - Interpolate AstroSpec object over some ranges Useful for interpolation over ranges containing spectral lines.

length - Return length of each spectrum in AstroSpec object

plot - Plot all the filters in an AstroTransmission object

readAstFilter - Read an (old) AstFilter into AstroTransmission

scaleSynphot - Scale spectrum such that its synthetic magnitude will be forced to some value.

selectWave - Select lines from AstroSpec (don't generate a new copy)

set.WaveUnits - setter for WaveUnits - convert Wave property

sort - Sort elements of AstroTransmission object by wavelength

synphot - Synthetic photometry on an AstroSpec object spectra

unitTest - unitTest for AstroSpec
