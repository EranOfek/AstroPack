# Class: obs.DbDriver



    
    PostgreSQL Database Class  
      
    The native Matlab database functions requires installation of the Matlab  
    Database Toolbox. To avoid dependency on it, we implement our database  
    class using the Java packages.  
      
    Some workaround is required to use the java interface.
