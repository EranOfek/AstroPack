Package: imProc.instCharc

gainFromFlat - Estimate the gain from flat image/s in native units. Estimated by dividing the mean by the variance.

linearity - Estimate the non-linearity of a detector using the imUtil.calib.pixel_flat_response function

readNoiseFromBias - Estimate the read noise from bias mage/s in native units. The read noise is estimated by calculating the rms in small blocks (sub images) of a bias image, or by calculating the rms per pixel (in multiple images).

unitTest - unitTest for imProc.instCharc Example: Result = imProc.instCharc.unitTest
