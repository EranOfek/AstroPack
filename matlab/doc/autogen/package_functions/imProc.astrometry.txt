Package: imProc.astrometry

addCoordinates2catalog - Add or update RA/Dec coordinates in catalogs in AstroImage/Astrocatalog

assessAstrometricQuality - Collect information regarding quality of astrometric solution and return a sucess flag.

astrometryCheck - Compare the astrometry of a catalog with a reference astrometric catalog. Return statistics regarding the matched sources, rms, rms as a function of position and mag.

astrometryCore - A core function for astrometry. Match pattern and fit transformation. The function is designed to solve the astrometry of an image in a single shoot (no partitioning). A new copy of the catalog is always created.

astrometryImage - 

astrometryRefine - Refine an astrometric solution of an AstroCatalog object This function may work on images which have either an approximate WCS (either in AstroHeader or AstroWCS), or a catalog with RA/Dec coordinates. The coordinates should be good to a few arcseconds. For no solutions use imProc.astrometry.astrometryCore.

astrometrySubImages - Solve astrometry for sub images of a single contigious image The solution is done by executing astrometryCore for a limited number of sub images, and astrometryRefine for all the rest, based on the solution from astrometryCore.

fitWCS - Perform the Tran2D.fitAstrometricTran and prepare the WCS info This is an auxilary function that performs the fitting stage between an astrometric catalog and an image catalog, and return the Tran2D object as well as the information needed for the WCS (e.g., CRPIX, CRVAL, etc.).

unitTest - unitTest for +imProc.astrometry Example: imProc.astrometry.unitTest
