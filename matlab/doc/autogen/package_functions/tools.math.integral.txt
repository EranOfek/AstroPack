int2d - Numerical integration of a 2-D matrix Package: Util.math Description: Numerically interagte a 2-D matrix.

integral_percentile - Given a tabulate function find limits that contains percentile Package: Util.math Description: Given a numerically tabulated function (X,Y) and a percentile P, find the limits (a,b) such that int_{a}^{b}(Y(X)dx)=P (i.e., the integral of Y(X) from a

quad_mult2bound - Numerical integration using quad, where the upper bound is a vector Package: Util.integral Description: Numerical interation using the built in quad.m function where the upper bound of the interation is a vector. To speed the calculation the program sorts the upper bound

quad_my - Pass arguments to function in quad Package: Util.integral Description: A version of the built in quad.m function in which it is possible to pass additional parameters to the function, with no need for nested functions.

sp_powerlaw_int - sp_powerlaw_int function                                         General Description: Calculate the value the spherical integral and the line integral of a broken power law of the form: rho = K R^(-W1)               R<=R0

summatlevel - summatlevel function                                             General Description: Given a matrix and a level value, return the sum of all the values in the matrix which are larger than the level.

trapzmat - Trapezoidal numerical integration on columns or rows of matrices. Package: Util.math Description: Trapezoidal numerical integration on columns or rows of matrices. Contrary to trapz.m, the X input for this function can
