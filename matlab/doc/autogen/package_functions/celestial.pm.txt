fitMultiProperMotion - Simultanoulsy (fast) fit proper motion and stationary model to observations The fit is done in RA/Dec space, and no cos(delta) is applied Perform hypothesis testing between the proper motion and stationary models.

searchCatForKnownPM - Given a catalog of sources positions and times, and a specific position+proper motion, look for sources in the catalog that are found in the proper motion trajectory.
