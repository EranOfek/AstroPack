Package: imUtil.cat

affine2d_transformation - Applay a 2D affine transformation to [X,Y] coordinates Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Applay a 2D affine transformation to [X,Y] coordinates

astrometric_cat - Get astrometric catalog, corrected for proper motion Package: +imUtil.cat

dilute_cat_by_mag - Remove faint sources from a catalog to have a specific surface density Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Dilute sources from a acatalog based on sources magnitude. Remove the faintest sources and sources which have NaN magnitude, such that the surface density of the diluted

flag_overdense - Flag sources that are found in overdense (box shaped) regions Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Given a catalog of [X,Y] positions, flag sources that are found in regions which their density is above a threshold. The function uses two algorithms:

flag_overdense_colrow - Flag sources that are found in overdense (box shaped) regions Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Given a catalog of [X,Y] positions, flag sources that are found in regions which their density is above a threshold. The function uses two algorithms:

match_sources - Match sources in two catalogs with the same coordinates systems. Package: imUtil.cat Description: Match a catalog and reference catalog which are on the same 2-D coordinate system. The catalogs may have spherical or planner coordinates.

match_sources_xy - Match sources between Cat and Ref catalogs using their X/Y (planar) coordinates. Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Matched the sources in Cat to sources in Ref by planar X/Y coordinates.

surface_density - Estimate surface density in catalog, optionally using convex hull Package: +imUtil.cat Description: Estimate the surface density and area that a catalog is covering. The area is estimated using either the box size, circle radius, and if not provided using the convex hull.
