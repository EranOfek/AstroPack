Package: celestial.scheduling

LAST_scheduler - 

LAST_simulator - Simulate LAST targets scheduling Package: +celestial.schedling Description:

assign_targets2telescopes - 

coo_visibility - Calculate the visibility of celestial coordinates Package: +celestial.scheduling Description: For a given night, and a list of targets, calculate the matrix of target visibility in 5-min (default) steps. The visibility criteria, includes SunAltLimit, MaxAM,

fermiexp - Fermi rise - Exp decay weight function Package: +celestial.scheduling

target_selection - Select a single target for one telescope Package: +celestial.scheduling Example: Res=celestial.scheduling.target_selection

validate_coo - Validate HA, Dec within Az,Alt and HA,Dec ranges. Package: +celestial.scheduling Description: Given a vectors of HA/Dec check for each coordinate if it complies with Az,Alt limit and withing HA/Dec ranges.

weight_cadence - Calculate the cadence weight for a list of targets. Package: +celestial.scheduling Description: The cadence weight is a combination of two weights, based on the last time the target was observed during the night, and the last time it was observed before the current night.

weights_fun - 'exp' - A + B*exp(-t/C) 'fermi' - A + B/(1+ exp(-(t-C)/D))
