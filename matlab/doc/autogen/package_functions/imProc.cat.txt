Package: imProc.cat

applyProperMotion - Apply proper motion and parallax to sources in AstroCatalog object

filterForAstrometry - Given two catalogs, match their surface density and filter sources. Description: Given two catalogs (e.g., Cat and Ref), clean the catalogs by removing NaN coordinates, imUtil.cat.flag_overdense_colrow, imUtil.cat.flag_overdense, estimate their density using imUtil.cat.surface_density, and

fitPeakMultipleColumns - Given N columns with some property (e.g., S/N) fit a parabola to the S/N values as a function of some parameter (e.g., FWHM), and return the peak S/N value and position. The best fitted S/N and position, as well as the best S/N column value and index are optionally wrotten to the AstroCatalog.

getAstrometricCatalog - Get Astrometric catalog from local/external database and optionally apply proper motion, parallax and units conversions.

insertAzAlt - Calculate and insert Az, Alt, AirMass, ParAng columns to AstroCatalog object

unitTest - unitTest for imProc.cat Example: imProc.cat.unitTest
