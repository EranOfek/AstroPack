find_registration_trans - Example: imUtil.patternMatch.find_registration_trans

find_rot_pairs - Find the best rotation required to match two catalogs using dist-rot hist Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Find the best rotation required to match two catalogs using The Kaiser method. The histogram of the distance and

find_scalerot_pairs - Find rotation and scale required to match two catalogs using logdist-rot hist Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Find the best rotation and scale and flip (by that order) needed to be applied to a acatalog in order to match it

find_shift_pairs - find best X/Y shift between two catalogs from all pairs differences Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Find best X/Y shift between two catalogs that contains [X,Y] positions. The shifts are identified by calculating the

find_shift_xc_bincat - find best X/Y shift between two catalogs from xcorr binned catalogs Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Find best X/Y shift between two catalogs that contains [X,Y] positions. The shifts are identified by calculating the

fit_astrometric_tran - Fit astrometric transformation Package: +imUtil.patternMatch Description: Fit astrometruc transformation to two matched catalogs. Xref = a_0 + a_1*Xcat + a_2*Ycat + ...

fit_astrometry - Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description:

hist2d - calculate the 2-D histogram of 2-D data set. Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: calculate the 2-D histogram of 2-D data set.

match_scale_rot_shift - Affine transformation matching of the coordinate systems of two catalogs Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Given two catalogs that coordinadte systems are related by flip, scale, rotation and shift, search the the approximate

matched_cat_residuals - Calculate the astrometric residuals and errors between two matched catalogs Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Given a catalog (Cat) and a reference catalog (Ref), both containing astrometric X/Y measurments of matched sources

prep_cat_for_astrometry - Clean two catalogs and equalize their surface density Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Given two catalogs (e.g., Cat and Ref), clean the catalogs by removing NaN coordinates,

refine_fit - Match sources in two catalogs and fit a positional transformation Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Given two catalogs of sources that have rougghly the same coordinate system (e.g., images are aligned to a few pixels

select_maxima - Select some maxima out of list by some criteria Package: imUtil.patternMatch Description: Given a list of maxima, select a sub list by some criteria. For example, can be used to select N highest peaks, or all
