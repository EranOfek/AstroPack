Package: imUtil.background

annulus_filter - Apply annului filters to an image Package: @imUtil.background

background - Estimate the background and its variance for an astronomical image Package: @imUtil.background Description: A wrapper function for estimating the background and background variance of an imaage in a matrix form. The function partition the image into sub images

collapse_stat - Collapse an image on one dimension and calc line statistics Package: @imUtil.background Description: Collapse an image on one dimension and calculate the line statistics including smooth background level, and std estimate.

fill_sparse - given a list of sparse 2D positions and values, fill an image by interp Package: @imUtil.background

flag_badcol - Flag a bad column/row in an image Package: @imUtil.background Description: Flag a column/row which background/noise level is high.

mode - Mode and variance of a distribution Package: @imUtil.background Description: Calculate the mode and robust variance of an array. The mode is calculated by making an histogram and choosing the bin with the highest number of counts. The robust

rstd - robust std (default is for a matrix) calculated using scaled iqr Package: @imUtil.background Description: robust std of an array. Note that using the imUtil.background.mode function is much faster.

rvar - robust variance (default is for a matrix) calculated using scaled iqr Package: @imUtil.background Description: robust variance of an array. Note that using the imUtil.background.mode function is much faster.
