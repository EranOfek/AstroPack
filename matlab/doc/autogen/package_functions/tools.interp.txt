Package: tools.interp

bessel_icoef - Calculate the Bessel interpolation coefficiant. Package: Util.interp Description: Calculate the Bessel interpolation coefficiant.

interp1_nan - Interpolate over NaNs in 1-D vector. Package: Util.interp Description: Interpolate over NaNs in 1-D vector.

interp1_sinc - 1-D sinc interpolation Package: Util.interp Description: Interpolation of a 1-D array using the Whittakerâ€“Shannon interpolation formula (i.e., sinc interpolation).

interp1evenlySpaced - A faster versio of interp1q for evenly spaced data (linear interpolation).

interp1lanczos - 1-D Lanczos interpolation Package: Util.interp Description: 1D Lanczos interpolation.

interp2fast - Faster version of interp2 Package: Util.interp Description: A faster version of the interp2.m built in function. This function is faster than interp2.m when the XI and YI vectors span over a small range in the VecX and VecY

interp3p - Stirling interpolation Package: Util.interp Description: Given three, equally spaced, data points (Y), and a vector of normalized positions in units in which the three data points are at [-1,0,1], return, based on the Stirling

interp_diff - Interpolation based on 4th order Stirling formula Package: Util.interp Description: Interpolation of equally spaced data using high-order differences.

interp_diff_ang - Stirling 4th order interpolation for angular values Package: tools.interp Description: Given a vector of time and a vector of coordinate on a sphere interpolate the spherical coordinate in a list of times. This function is talking into account

interp_diff_longlat - Bessel interpolation of equally space time series of lon/lat coordinates Package: Util Description: Interpolate equally space time series of lon/lat coordinates using 4th order Bessel differences interpolation.
