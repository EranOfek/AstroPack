Package: imUtil.image

combine_proper - Proper coaddition of images in a cube Package: imUtil.image Description: Proper coaddition (Zackay & Ofek 2017) of images in a cube

cube_chi2 - Calculate the sigma-clipped mean of a dataset Package: imUtil.image Description: Calculate the sigma-clipped mean of a dataset with iterations.

find_within_radius_cell - Find points within a radius from a list of coordinates. Package: imUtil.image Description: Given a list of coordinates within an array, return for each coordinate a vector (within a cell array) of indices of the points in the image

find_within_radius_mat - Construct a cube of stamps around specific locations in a 2D image. Package: imUtil.image Description: Given an image and a list of coordinates, construct a cybe of stamps around the coordinates. Region outside the image are padded with zeros.

fun_binary_withVariance - Applay an operator on an array and its variance.

fun_cutouts - Apply a function thar returns a scalar to all cutouts in image around locations.
