Package: imProc.match

coneSearch - cone search(s) on AstroCatalog/AstroImage object

flagSrcWithNeighbors - Flag sources in AstroCatalog which have neighbors within a radius Optionaly, remove sources with neighboors.

inPolygon - Return sources inside polygon

insertCol_matchIndices - Insert Dist/Nmatch columns to a single element AstroCatalog based on ResInd. This is a utility function for users of imProc.match.matchReturnIndices. The function gets the input of imProc.match.matchReturnIndices (called here ResInd), and produce two AstroCatalog objects:

match - Match two catalogs in AstroCatalog objects This functin returens: a matched source catalog, and an unmatched source catalog. The matched catalog result has the same number of sources as in the Obj2 catalog, and for each Obj2 source,

match2solarSystem - Match sources in AstroCatalog object to Solar System objects. This is done using the celestial.OrbitalEl class. For each source in the AstroCatalog, search for minor planets at the same position and epoch. Returns the lines from the AstroCatalog that are matched with

matchReturnIndices - Match two catalogs in AstroCatalog objects and return the matched indices. This is a basic utility function that returns the two-directional indices of the matched sources. This function is used by the more advanced matching programs.

match_catsHTM - Match an AstroCatalog object with catsHTM catalog

matched2matrix - A matched AstroCatalog object into a matrix of epochs by index AstCat object to a matrix of matched sources. Description: Given an AstroCatalog object containing multiple elements, in which each element containing the same number of rows (e.g., the output of Match/match.m), return a matrix

unifiedSourcesCatalog - Match multiple catalogs and create a catalog of all unique (by position) sources. i.e., generate a list of all unique positions that appears in all the AstroCatalog object.

unitTest - unitTest for +imProc.match Example: imProc.match.unitTest
