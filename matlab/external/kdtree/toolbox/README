Package: kdtree 2.0
Author: Andrea Tagliasacchi
Date: June 5 2012

%------------------  DESCRIPTION -----------------%
kdtree provides a minimalistic implementation of kd-tree.
The implementation can be used either inside MATLAB by means
of MEX calls, or as a standalone tool, directly from a C/C++
program. 

The image on the website has been creaed with "kdtree_figure_demo.m"

%------------------  FUNCTIONALITIES -----------------%
This implementation offers the following functionalities:  
- KDTree (Matlab Class)         wraps all of the following
- kdtree_build: 		        k-d tree construction O( n log(n) )
- kdtree_delete:		        frees memory allocated by kdtree
- kdtree_nearest_neighbor:      nearest neighbor query (for one or more points) 
- kdtree_k_nearest_neighbors:   kNN for a single query point  
- kdtree_range_query:           rectangular range query
- kdtree_ball_query:            queries samples withing distance delta from a point  

%------------------  FILE STRUCTURE -----------------%
Everyone of the scripts/functions is complete of the following:
*.cpp:      the mex implementation of the sources
*.mexmaci:  the compiled version of the mex (intel mac)
*.m:        the comments that you can browse with the "help" command
*_demo.m:   demo file to illustrate the behavior

%------------------  HOW COMPILE  -----------------%
IMPORTANT NOTE: I assume you have a correctly configured MEX environment 
within matlab using:

>> mex -config

Compiling can be done in two ways. The first is directly inside MATLAB.
You can compile manually each of the files by calling the command mex 
within the kdtree folder from the MATLAB command line. For example:

>> mex kdtree_build.cpp

or alternatively one of the two to compile the whole library:

>> KDTree.compile
>> kdtree_compile
 
Alternatively, if you are in a unix environment, you might also be able 
to use the provided makefile. In order to do this you need to change some
of the environment variables in order to make them point to your local 
MATLAB installation.
 
%-------------- COMPATIBILITY NOTES --------------%
A wrong compiler might manifest an error like: "fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR".
KDTree compiles correctly with the following compilers:  
- i686-apple-darwin9-g++-4.0.1 (GCC) 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5484)
- Visual studio c++ 6.0 with Service pack 6
