// function c = MADD(a, b)
//   MADD  Adds two vectors, a and b, using multiple threads. With inline
//   comments to help myself and other people figure out what's going on
//   with multi-threaded MEX functions in MATLAB.
//   
//   Use the following command to build this MEX file:
//       mex -R2018a madd.cpp
//   
//   Since this is used only for learning purposes, if the total number of
//   elements in a and b aren't a multiples of the number of threads
//   available, then mod(numel(a), nthreads) elements will be left as 0.
//   
//   I figured out a lot of this stuff by reading through Yair Altman's
//   article on multi-threaded mex functions:
//   
//     https://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/multi-threaded-mex
//   
//   Everything here is for Windows, but if you want to use non-Windows you
//   can take a look at pthreads, e.g. as described in the above article or
//   elsewhere throughout the internet.  Also, after running through some
//   performance testing: always always always figure out how to vectorize
//   your code when you can.  Good MATLAB code is always faster than
//   terrible C code.
