## Read file from file sysyem in SELECT

I am using postgres, and want to use select statement and ask it to read 
file from file system, and return it as one of the columns of the select result.

PostgreSQL does not have a built-in function to read files from the file system 
directly in a SELECT statement. However, you can use a combination of external 
functions and the PostgreSQL COPY command to achieve this.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

Create a function that reads the file and returns its content as a bytea (binary data) object:


	CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION read_file(filename text)
	RETURNS bytea AS
	$$
	DECLARE
	  file_content bytea;
	BEGIN
	  SELECT pg_read_binary_file(filename) INTO file_content;
	  RETURN file_content;
	END;
	$$
	LANGUAGE plpgsql;


This function uses the pg_read_binary_file function, which is a built-in PostgreSQL function that 
reads a file from the file system and returns its content as a bytea object.

Use the COPY command to execute the SELECT statement and write the results to a file:


	COPY (
	  SELECT id, name, read_file('/path/to/file') AS file_content
	  FROM my_table
	) TO '/path/to/output_file.csv' WITH CSV;


In this example, the SELECT statement includes the read_file function, which reads a file 
from the file system and returns its content as a bytea object. The COPY command is then used 
to write the results of the SELECT statement to a CSV file, including the file content 
as one of the columns.

Note that the COPY command can only write data to a file, not read data from a file. 
So, you'll need to use this method if you want to include file content in a SELECT result.



## Write column to table using UPDATE

To insert or update a column in a PostgreSQL table with the contents of a file, 
you can use the COPY command along with an external function that reads the 
file and returns its contents.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

Create a function that reads the file and returns its contents as a text:


	CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION read_file_contents(filename text)
	RETURNS text AS
	$$
	DECLARE
	  file_content text;
	BEGIN
	  SELECT pg_read_file(filename, 0, pg_stat_file(filename).size) INTO file_content;
	  RETURN file_content;
	END;
	$$
	LANGUAGE plpgsql;


This function uses the pg_read_file function, which is a built-in PostgreSQL function 
that reads a file from the file system and returns its contents as text.

Use the COPY command to insert or update a column with the file contents:

To insert new rows into the table using the file contents:

	COPY my_table (id, name, file_content)
	FROM '/path/to/file'
	WITH CSV HEADER;

	UPDATE my_table
	SET file_content = read_file_contents('/path/to/file');



In this example, the COPY command inserts new rows into the my_table table using the 
contents of the file located at /path/to/file. The WITH CSV HEADER clause tells PostgreSQL 
to use the first row of the file as the column names for the new rows.

After inserting the new rows, you can use the UPDATE command to update the file_content 
column in existing rows with the contents of the file. The read_file_contents function 
is used to read the file and return its contents as text.

To update an existing row with the file contents:

	UPDATE my_table
	SET file_content = read_file_contents('/path/to/file')
	WHERE id = 123;


In this example, the UPDATE command updates the file_content column of the row with id 
equal to 123 with the contents of the file located at /path/to/file. 
The read_file_contents function is used to read the file and return its contents as text.
